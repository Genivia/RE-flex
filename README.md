A high-performance C++ regex library and lexical analyzer generator with
Unicode support.

Two example use cases:

1. A RE/flex-generated tokenizer is used by the
   [Tiger Compiler](https://assignments.lrde.epita.fr/tools/reflex.html).
2. The RE/flex C++ regex engines are used by [ugrep](https://ugrep.com).

The RE/flex lexical analyzer generator extends Flex++ with Unicode support,
indent/dedent anchors, POSIX regex lazy quantifiers, word boundaries, functions
for lex and syntax error reporting, lexer rule execution performance profiling,
and other new features.

Only RE/flex supports POSIX regex lazy matching in linear time using an
advanced DFA transformation algorithm invented by Dr. Robert van Engelen.

RE/flex is faster than Flex and much faster than regex libraries such as
Boost.Regex, C++11 std::regex, PCRE2 and RE2.  For example, tokenizing a 2 KB
representative C source code file into 244 tokens takes only 8.7 microseconds:

<table>

Note: *performance in elapsed time (lower is better) in microseconds for 1000 to 10000
benchmark runs using Mac OS X 12.6.9 with clang 12.0.0 -O2, 2.9 GHz Intel Core
i7, 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3.  Hyperscan disqualifies as a scanner due to its "All
matches reported" semantics resulting in 1915 matches for this test, and due to
its event handler requirements.*

The performance table is indicative of the impact on performance when using
PCRE2 and Boost.Regex with RE/flex.  PCRE2 and Boost.Regex are optional
libraries integrated with RE/flex for Perl matching because of their
efficiency.  By default, RE/flex uses DFA-based extended regular expression
matching in linear time, the fastest method (as shown in the table).

The RE/flex matcher tracks line numbers, column numbers, and indentations,
whereas Flex does not (option noyylineno) and neither do the other regex
matchers in the table (except PCRE2 and Boost.Regex when used with RE/flex).
Tracking this information incurs some overhead.  RE/flex also automatically
decodes UTF-8/16/32 input and accepts `std::istream`, strings, and wide strings
as input.

Features
--------

- Includes many examples, such as a mini C compiler to Java bytecode, a
  tokenizer for C/C++ source code, a tokenizer for Python source code, a
  tokenizer for Java source code, Lua, JSON, XML, YAML, and more.
- Compatible with Flex and Bison to eliminate a learning curve, making a
  transition from Flex++ to RE/flex frustration-free.
- Auto-generates code that integrates seamlessly with Bison Reentrant,
  Bison-Bridge, Bison-Locations, Bison 3.0 C++ interface `%skeleton
  "lalr1.cc"` and Bison Complete Symbols.
- Generates code and includes methods for lexical and syntax error reporting
  and recovery.
- The generated scanner source code is structured and easy to understand.
- Fully supports Unicode and Unicode properties `\p{C}`, including Unicode
  identifier matching for C++11, Java, C#, and Python source code.
- Auto-detects UTF-8/16/32 input to match Unicode patterns.
- Supports file encodings ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-15, CP 1250 through 1258,
  CP 437, CP 850, CP 858, KOI8, MACROMAN, EBCDIC, and custom code pages.
- Generates scanners for lexical analysis on files, C++ streams, (wide)
  strings, and memory such as mmap files.
- Indent/nodent/dedent anchors to match indentation levels to tokenize.
- Lazy quantifiers for POSIX regex matching, i.e. no hacks are needed to work
  around greedy repetitions.
- Word boundary anchors.
- Freespace mode option to improve readability of lexer specifications.
- `%class` and `%init` to customize the generated Lexer classes.
- `%include` to modularize lexer specifications.
- Multiple lexer classes can be combined and used in one application, e.g. by
  multiple threads in a thread-safe manner.
- Configurable Lexer class generation to customize the interface for various
  parsers, including Yacc and Bison.
- Generates Graphviz files to visualize FSMs with the Graphviz dot tool.
- Includes an extensible hierarchy of pattern matcher engines, with a choice of
  regex engines, including the RE/flex regex engine, PCRE2, and Boost.Regex.
- The RE/flex regex library makes C++11 std::regex, PCRE2, and Boost.Regex much
  easier to use for pattern matching on (wide) strings, files, and streams.
- IEEE POSIX P1003.2 standard compliant (like Lex and Flex).
- Extensive documentation in the online [User Guide][manual-url].
- Lots of other improvements over Flex++, such as `yypush_buffer_state` saves
  the scanner state (line, column, and indentation positions), not just the
  input buffer; no input buffer length limit (Flex has a 16KB limit); `line()`
  returns the current line (e.g. for error reporting).

Note: PCRE2 and Boost.Regex are not dependencies, they can be used as optional
regex engines in addition to the RE/flex regex engine.

Installation
------------

### Windows

Use `reflex/bin/reflex.exe` from the command line or add a **Custom Build
Step** in MSVC++ as follows:

1. select the project name in **Solution Explorer** then **Property Pages**
   from the **Project** menu (see also
   [custom-build steps in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hefydhhy.aspx));

2. add an extra path to the `reflex/include` folder in the **Include
   Directories** under **VC++ Directories**, which should look like
   `$(VC_IncludePath);$(WindowsSDK_IncludePath);C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\reflex\include`
   (this assumes the `reflex` source package is in your **Documents** folder).

3. enter `"C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\reflex\bin\win32\reflex.exe" --header-file
   "C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\mylexer.l"` in the **Command Line** property
   under **Custom Build Step** (this assumes `mylexer.l` is in your
   **Documents** folder);

4. enter `lex.yy.h lex.yy.cpp` in the **Outputs** property;

5. specify **Execute Before** as `PreBuildEvent`.

If you are using specific reflex options such as `--flex` then add these in step 3.

Before compiling your program with MSVC++, drag the folders `reflex/lib` and
`reflex/unicode` to the **Source Files** in the **Solution Explorer** panel of
your project.  Next, run `reflex.exe` simply by compiling your project (which
may fail, but that is OK for now as long as we executed the custom build step
to run `reflex.exe`).  Drag the generated `lex.yy.h` (if present) and
`lex.yy.cpp` files to the **Source Files**.  Now you are all set!

In addition, the `reflex/vs` directory contains batch scripts to build projects
with MS Visual Studio C++.

### MacOS

On macOS systems you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install RE/flex
with `brew install re-flex`.  Or use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org)
to install RE/flex with `sudo port install re-flex`.

### NetBSD

On NetBSD systems you can use the standard NetBSD package installer (pkgsrc):
<http://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/devel/RE-flex/README.html>

### Quick install

First clone the code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Genivia/RE-flex

Then simply do a quick clean build, assuming your environment is pretty much
standard:

    $ ./clean.sh
    $ ./build.sh

This compiles the **reflex** tool and installs it locally in `reflex/bin`.  For
local use of RE/flex in your project, you can add this location to your `$PATH`
variable to enable the new `reflex` command:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/your_path_to_reflex/reflex/bin

Note that the `libreflex.a` and `libreflex.so` libraries are saved locally in
`reflex/lib`.  Link against the library when you use the RE/flex regex engine
in your code, such as:

    $ c++ <options and .o/.cpp files> -L/your_path_to_reflex/reflex/lib -lreflex

or you could statically link libreflex.a with:

    $ c++ <options and .o/.cpp files> /your_path_to_reflex/reflex/lib/libreflex.a

Also note that the RE/flex header files that you will need to include in your
project are locally located in `include/reflex`.

To install the man page, the header files in `/usr/local/include/reflex`, the
library in `/usr/local/lib` and the `reflex` command in `/usr/local/bin`:

    $ sudo ./allinstall.sh

### Configure and make

The configure script accepts configuration and installation options.  To view
these options, run:

    $ ./configure --help

Run configure and make:

    $ ./configure && make

To build the examples also:

    $ ./configure --enable-examples && make

After this successfully completes, you can optionally run `make install` to
install the `reflex` command and the `libreflex` library:

    $ sudo make install

Unfortunately, cloning from Git does not preserve timestamps which means that
you may run into "WARNING: 'aclocal-1.15' is missing on your system."  To
work around this problem, run:

    $ autoreconf -fi
    $ ./configure && make

The above builds the library with SSE/AVX optimizations applied.  To disable
AVX optimizations:

    $ ./configure --disable-avx && make

To disable both SSE2 and AVX optimizations:

    $ ./configure --disable-sse2 && make

### Optional libraries to install

- To use PCRE2 as a regex engine with the RE/flex library and scanner
  generator, install [PCRE2][pcre-url] and link your code with `-lpcre2-8`.

- To use Boost.Regex as a regex engine with the RE/flex library and scanner
  generator, install [Boost][boost-url] and link your code with
  `-lboost_regex` or `-lboost_regex-mt`.

- To visualize the FSM graphs generated with **reflex** option `--graphs-file`,
  install [Graphviz dot][dot-url].

### Improved Vim syntax highlighting

Copy the `lex.vim` file to `~/.vim/syntax/` to enjoy improved syntax
highlighting for both Flex and RE/flex.


Usage
-----

There are two ways you can use this project:

1. as a scanner generator for C++, similar to Flex;
2. as a flexible regex library API for C++.

For the first option, simply build the **reflex** tool and run it on the
command line on a lexer specification:

    $ reflex --flex --bison --graphs-file lexspec.l

This generates a scanner for Bison from the lexer specification `lexspec.l` and
saves the finite state machine (FSM) as a Graphviz `.gv` file that can be
visualized with the [Graphviz dot][dot-url] tool:

    $ dot -Tpdf reflex.INITIAL.gv > reflex.INITIAL.pdf
    $ open reflex.INITIAL.pdf

![Visualize DFA graphs with Graphviz dot][FSM-url]

Several examples are included to get you started.  See the [manual][manual-url]
for more details.

For the second option, simply use the RE/flex matcher API classes to start
pattern search, matching, splitting and scanning on strings, wide strings,
files, and streams.

You can select matchers that are based on different regex engines:

- RE/flex regex: `#include <reflex/matcher.h>` and use `reflex::Matcher`;
- PCRE2: `#include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h>` and use `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` or
  `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher`.
- Boost.Regex: `#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>` and use
  `reflex::BoostMatcher` or `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher`;
- C++11 std::regex: `#include <reflex/stdmatcher.h>` and use
  `reflex::StdMatcher` or `reflex::StdPosixMatcher`.

Each matcher may differ in regex syntax features (see the full documentation),
but they all share the same methods and iterators, such as:

- `matches()` returns nonzero if the input matches the specified pattern;
- `find()` search input and returns nonzero if a match was found;
- `scan()` scan input and returns nonzero if input at current position matches;
- `split()` returns nonzero for a split of the input at the next match;
- `find.begin()`...`find.end()` filter iterator;
- `scan.begin()`...`scan.end()` tokenizer iterator;
- `split.begin()`...`split.end()` splitter iterator.

For example, using Boost.Regex (alternatively use PCRE2 `reflex::PCRE2Matcher`):

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to check if the birthdate string is a valid date
if (reflex::BoostMatcher("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}", birthdate).matches() != 0)
  std::cout << "Valid date!" << std::endl;
```

With a group capture to fetch the year:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to check if the birthdate string is a valid date
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("(\\d{4})-\\d{2}-\\d{2}", birthdate);
if (matcher.matches() != 0)
  std::cout << std::string(matcher[1].first, matcher[1].second) << " was a good year!" << std::endl;
```

To search a string for words `\w+`:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search for words in a sentence
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
while (matcher.find() != 0)
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
```

The `split` method is roughly the inverse of the `find` method and returns text
located between matches.  For example using non-word matching `\W+`:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search for words in a sentence
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\W+", "How now brown cow.");
while (matcher.split())
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
```

To pattern match the content of a file, where the file may use UTF-8, 16, or 32
encodings that are automatically converted when a UTF BOM is present:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search and display words from a FILE
FILE *fd = fopen("somefile.txt", "r");
if (fd == NULL)
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", fd);
while (matcher.find())
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
fclose(fd);
```

Same again, but this time with a C++ input stream:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
// use a BoostMatcher to search and display words from a stream
std::ifstream file("somefile.txt", std::ifstream::in);
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", file);
while (matcher.find())
  std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
file.close();
```

Stuffing the search results into a container using RE/flex iterators:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex
#include <vector>         // std::vector
// use a BoostMatcher to convert words of a sentence into a string vector
reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
std::vector<std::string> words(matcher.find.begin(), matcher.find.end());
```

Use C++11 range-based loops with RE/flex iterators:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/stdmatcher.h> // reflex::StdMatcher, reflex::Input, std::regex
// use a StdMatcher with std::regex to search for words in a sentence
reflex::StdMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
for (auto& match : matcher.find)
  std::cout << "Found " << match.text() << std::endl;
```

RE/flex also allows you to convert expressive regex syntax forms such as `\p`
Unicode classes, character class set operations such as `[a-z--[aeiou]]`,
escapes such as `\X`, and `(?x)` mode modifiers, to a regex string that the
underlying regex library understands and will be able to use:

- `std::string reflex::Matcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
- `std::string reflex::PCRE2Matcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
- `std::string reflex::BoostMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
- `std::string reflex::StdMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`

For example:

```{.cpp}
#include <reflex/matcher.h> // reflex::Matcher, reflex::Input, reflex::Pattern
// use a Matcher to check if sentence is in Greek:
static const reflex::Pattern pattern(reflex::Matcher::convert("[\\p{Greek}\\p{Zs}\\pP]+", reflex::convert_flag::unicode));
if (reflex::Matcher(pattern, sentence).matches() != 0)
  std::cout << "This is Greek" << std::endl;
```

We use `convert` with optional flag `reflex::convert_flag::unicode` to make `.`
(dot), `\w`, `\s` and so on match Unicode and to convert `\p` Unicode character
classes.

Conversion is fast (it runs in linear time in the size of the regex), but it is
not without some overhead.  Making converted regex patterns `static` as shown
above saves the cost of conversion to just once to support many matchings.
