What is RE/flex?                                                       {#intro}
================

A high-performance C++ regex library and a lexical analyzer generator like
Flex and Lex.

Firstly, the high-performance RE/flex regex engine internally builds finite
state machine tables or generates direct code to scan and search input
efficiently.

RE/flex also supports other regex engines under the same uniform C++ class API,
namely RE/flex with fuzzy matching, the PCRE2 library, the Boost.Regex library,
and std::regex.

This uniform API implements pattern matching on files, streams, strings, and
memory directly.  Input is internally buffered in a window so that very large
files can be searched.  File encodings are normalized to UTF-8 to apply UTF-8
Unicode regex pattern matching.

Secondly, the RE/flex lexical analyzer generator extends Flex++ with Unicode
support and many new useful features, such as regex indentation anchors, regex
lazy quantifiers, regex word boundaries, methods for error reporting and
recovery, and new options to simplify integration with with Bison and other
parsers.

The RE/flex lexical analyzer generator does all the heavy-lifting for you to
make it easier to integrate advanced tokenizers with Bison and other parsers.
It generates the necessary gluing code depending on the type of Bison parser
used, such as advanced "Bison complete parsers".

In a nutshell, the RE/flex lexical analyzer generator

- extends Flex++ with Unicode and other new featues
- accepts legacy Flex and Lex lexer specifications
- is compliant to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 standard on Lex specification input
  (but generates C++ source code, like Flex++ does)
- is faster than Flex++ for typical applications such as tokenization
- supports Unicode, auto-detects UTF-8/16/32 with smart input handling
- supports legacy file encoding formats, e.g. CP 1250, EBCDIC
- includes methods for lex and syntax \ref errors
- integrates with Bison reentrant, C++, bridge and location parsers
- generates source code that is easy to understand
- generates thread-safe scanners
- generates graphviz files for visualization of finite state machines
- supports easy customization of the lexer class source code output
- is fast with direct code and deterministic finite state machines
- supports "free space mode" to improve readability of lexer specifications
- regular expressions may contain lazy quantifiers
- regular expressions may contain word boundary anchors
- regular expressions may contain indent/dedent markers for matching
- offers other regex engines to choose from, such as PCRE2 and Boost.Regex
- is released under a permissive open source license (BSD-3)

RE/flex includes usability improvements over Flex++, such as:

- no input buffer length limit (Flex has a 16K limit);
- `yypush_buffer_state` saves the scanner state (line, column, and indentation
  positions), not just the input buffer;
- new methods to analyze ASCII and Unicode input, such as `str()` and `wstr()`
  to obtain the (wide) string match, `line()` and `wline()` to obtain the
  current (wide) line for error reporting.

Rule patterns in a lexer specification are converted by the <b>`reflex`</b>
tool to efficient deterministic finite state machines in direct code (option
`‚àí‚àífast` or in opcode tables `‚àí‚àífull`.  Other regex engines to choose from
include PCRE2 and Boost.Regex for Perl and POSIX matching modes.  UTF-8/16/32
file input normalization for Unicode pattern matching is performed
automatically.  Other encodings can be programmatically specified with minimal
codeing.  Therefore, RE/flex scanners can work on any type of input.

RE/flex incorporates proper object-oriented design principles and does not rely
on macros and globals as Flex does.  Macros and globals are added to the source
code generated by <b>`reflex`</b> only when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified.  A
RE/flex scanner is a generated class derived from a base lexer class template,
with its matcher engine defined as a template parameter.

RE/flex is compatible with Lex/Flex and Bison/Yacc with options `‚àí‚àíflex` and
`‚àí‚àíbison`, respectively.  Option `‚àí‚àíyy` forces basic, no-frills Lex POSIX
compliance of the lexer input (but with C++ output).  RE/flex also offers
specific options to seamlessly integrate Bison bridge, Bison locations, Bison
C++, Bison complete, and reentrant parsers.

In this document we refer to a *regex* as a shorthand for *regular expression*,
However, a "regular expression" refers to the formal concept of *regular
languages*, wheras *regex* often refers to backtracking-based regex matching
that Perl introduced.  Both concepts are applicable to RE/flex patterns.

In summary, RE/flex is really several things combined into one package:

- a faster, feature-rich extension of Flex++.

- a stand-alone regex library for fast regex matching in C++;

- a unified C++ regex API for the
  [PCRE2](https://www.pcre.org), [Boost.Regex](https://www.boost.org/libs/regex)
  and C++ `std::regex` libraries for matching, seaching, splitting and scanning
  of input, with input from (wide) strings, files, and streams of potentially
  unlimited length.

The typographical conventions used by this document are:

* `Courier` denotes C and C++ source code.

* <i>`Courier`</i> denotes lexer specifications and file names.

* <b>`Courier`</b> denotes commands and command or program output displayed in
  a terminal window.

Yet another scanner generator                                         {#intro1}
-----------------------------

Lex, Flex and variants are powerful *scanner generators* that generate scanners
(a.k.a. *lexical analyzers* and *lexers*) from lexer specifications.  The lexer
specifications define patterns with user-defined actions that are executed when
their patterns match the input stream.  The scanner repeatedly matches patterns
and triggers these actions until the end of the input stream is reached.

Both Lex and Flex are popular to develop *tokenizers* in which the user-defined
actions emit or return a *token* when the corresponding pattern matches.  These
tokenizers are typically implemented to scan and tokenize the source code for a
compiler or an interpreter of a programming language.  The *regular expression*
patterns in a tokenizer define the make-up of identifiers, constants, keywords,
punctuation, and to skip over white space in the source code that is scanned.

Consider for example the following patterns and associated actions defined in a
lexer specification:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%
    /* PATTERN */           /* ACTION */
    "if"                    return KEYWORD_IF;
    "*"                     return OP_MUL;
    "="                     return OP_ASSIGN;
    [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*  return ASCII_IDENTIFIER;
    [0-9]+                  return CONST_NUMBER;
    \"([^\\"]|\\")*\"       return CONST_STRING;
    [ \t\r\n]               /* no action: ignore all white space */
    %%
~~~
</div>

When the tokenizer matches a pattern, the corresponding action is invoked.  The
example above returns tokens to the compiler's parser, which repeatedly invokes
the tokenizer for more tokens until the tokenizer reaches the end of the input.
The tokenizer returns zero (0) when the end of the input is reached.

Lex and Flex have remained relatively stable (inert) tools while the demand has
increased for tokenizing Unicode texts encoded in common wide character formats
such as UTF-8, UCS/UTF-16, and UTF-32.  Also the regular expression syntax in
Flex/Lex is limited compared to modern regex syntax.  Flex has no support for
Unicode patterns, no lazy repetitions, no word boundary anchors, no indentation
matching with indent or dedent anchors, and a very limited collection of meta
escapes to choose from.  To make things even more interesting, it is a
challenge to write lexer specifications that avoid the "greedy trap" of POSIX
matching.

Flex/Lex scanners use POSIX pattern matching, meaning that the leftmost longest 
match is returned (among a set of patterns that match the same input).  Because
POSIX matchers produce the longest match for any given input text, we should be
careful when using patterns with "greedy" repetitions (`X*`, `X+` etc.) because
our pattern may gobble up more input than intended.  We end up falling into the
"greedy trap".

To illustrate this trap consider matching HTML comments `<!‚àí‚àí ... ‚àí‚àí>` with the
pattern `<!‚àí‚àí.*‚àí‚àí>`.  The problem is that the repetition `X*` is greedy and the
`.*‚àí‚àí>` pattern matches everything until the last `‚àí‚àí>` while moving over `‚àí‚àí>` 
that are between the `<!‚àí‚àí` and the last `‚àí‚àí>`.

@note Dot `.` normally does not match newline `\n` in Flex/Lex patterns, unless
we use *dot-all mode* that is sometimes confusingly called "single line mode".

We can use much more complex patterns such as `<!‚àí‚àí([^‚àí]|‚àí[^‚àí]|‚àí‚àí+[^‚àí>])*‚àí*‚àí‚àí>`
just to match comments in HTML, by ensuring the pattern ends at the first match
of a `‚àí‚àí>` in the input and not at the very last `‚àí‚àí>` in the input.  The POSIX
leftmost longest match can be surprisingly effective in rendering our tokenizer
into works of ASCII art!

We may claim our intricate pattern trophies as high achievements to the project
team, but our team will quickly point out that a regex `<!‚àí‚àí.*?‚àí‚àí>` suffices to
match HTML comments with the *lazy repetition* `X*?` construct, also known as a
*non-greedy repeat*.  The `?` is a *lazy quantifier* that modifies the behavior
of the `X*?` repeat to match only `X` repeately if the rest of the pattern does
not match.  Therefore, the regex `<!‚àí‚àí.*?‚àí‚àí>` matches HTML comments and nothing
more.

But Flex/Lex does not permit us to be lazy!

Not surprising, even the Flex manual shows ad-hoc code rather than a pattern to
scan over C/C++ source code input to match multiline comments that start with a
`/*` and end with the first occurrence of a `*/`.  The Flex manual recommends:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    "/*"    {  /* skip multiline comments */
      int c;
      while ((c = yyinput()) != 0)
      {
        if (c == '\n')
          ++mylineno;
        else if (c == '*')
        {
          if ((c = yyinput()) == '/')
            break;
          unput(c);
        }
      }
    }
~~~
</div>

Another argument to use this code with Flex is that the internal Flex buffer is
limited to 16K.  By contrast, RE/flex buffers are dynamically resized and will
never run out of buffer space to accept long matches.

Workarounds such as these are not necessary with RE/flex.  The RE/flex scanners
use regex libraries with expressive pattern syntax.  We can use lazy repetition
to write a regex pattern for multiline comments as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    "/*"(.|\n)*?"*/"  /* no action: ignore multiline comments */
~~~
</div>

Most regex libraries support syntaxes and features that we have come to rely on
for pattern matching.  A regex with lazy quantifiers can be much easier to read
and comprehend compared to a greedy variant.  Most regex libraries that support
lazy quantifiers run in Perl mode, using backtracking over the input.  Scanners
use POSIX mode matching, meaning that the leftmost longest match is found.  The
difference is important as we saw earlier and even more so when we consider the
problems with Perl mode matching when specifying patterns to tokenize input, as
we will explain next.

Consider the lexer specification example shown earlier.  Suppose the input text 
to tokenize is `iflag = 1`.  In POSIX mode we return `ASCII_IDENTIFIER` for the
name `iflag`, `OP_ASSIGN` for `=`, and `NUMBER` for `1`.  In Perl mode, we find
that `iflag` matches `if` and the rest of the name is not consumed, which gives
`KEYWORD_IF` for `if`, `ASCII_IDENTIFIER` for `lag`, `OP_ASSIGN` for `=`, and a
`NUMBER` for `1`.  Perl mode matching greedely returns leftmost matches.

Using Perl mode in a scanner requires all overlapping patterns to be defined in
a lexer specification such that all longest matching patterns are defined first
to ensure longest matches.  By contrast, POSIX mode is *declarative* and allows
you to define the patterns in the specification in any order.  Perhaps the only
ordering constraint on patterns is for patterns that match the same input, such
such as matching the keyword `if` in the example:  `KEYWORD_IF` must be matched
before `ASCII_IDENTIFIER`.

For this reason, RE/flex scanners use a regex library in POSIX mode by default.

In summary:

- RE/flex specifications and use are compatible with Lex/Flex and Bison/Yacc.

- The RE/flex scanner generator accepts specifications that are compatible with
  Flex, with additional options to select a matcher engine and to specify names
  and options for C++ class generation.
  
- The RE/flex scanner generator option `‚àí‚àíbison` generates a scanner compatible
  with Bison.  RE/flex also offers options to integrate Bison bridge, Bison
  locations, Bison complete, and reentrant parsers.

- The regular expression syntax in Flex and Lex specifications is restricted to
  POSIX ERE.  By contrast, the RE/flex specification syntax is regex-centric by
  design and offers a much richer pattern syntax, including lazy quantifiers.

- A matcher engine for a lexer class has a common interface API declared by the
  abstract base matcher class template.

- RE/flex scanners are not implemented as a set of global functions and tables.
  RE/flex scanners are instances of generated lexer classes, which ensures that
  scanners are thread-safe (by contrast, Flex and Flex++ are not thread-safe).
  A lexer class is derived from an abstract base lexer class template and it is
  instantiated with a regex matcher engine class that is provided as a template
  parameter.

- Lex and Flex scanners are restricted to ASCII or 8-bit character sets without
  adequate support for Unicode.  RE/flex specifications are extended to support
  Unicode such that the RE/flex scanner generator produces scanners that handle
  UTF-8/16/32 input files automatically.

- Input to matcher engines and scanners is implemented as a class that supports
  streaming sources of input and automatically decodes UTF-encoded files.

- RE/flex scanners can be stand-alone applications, similar to Flex scanners.  

\ref reflex section has more details on the RE/flex scanner generator tool.

In the next part of this manual, we will take a quick look at the RE/flex regex
API that can be used as a stand-alone library for matching, searching, scanning
and splitting input from strings, files and streams in regular C++ applications
(i.e. applications that are not necessarily tokenizers for compilers).

Flexible high-performance regex classes                               {#intro2}
---------------------------------------

The regex pattern matching C++ classes include the high-performance RE/flex
regex engine, the RE/flex fuzzy matching engine, classes for Boost.Regex,
classes for PCRE2, and classes for C++11 std::regex:

  Engine        | Header file to include  | C++ matcher classes
  ------------- | ----------------------- | -----------------------------------
  RE/flex regex | `reflex/matcher.h`      | `reflex::Matcher`
  RE/flex regex | `reflex/fuzzymatcher.h` | `reflex::FuzzyMatcher`
  PCRE2         | `reflex/pcre2matcher.h` | `reflex::PCRE2Matcher`, `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher`
  Boost.Regex   | `reflex/boostmatcher.h` | `reflex::BoostMatcher`, `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher`, `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher`
  std::regex    | `reflex/stdmatcher.h`   | `reflex::StdMatcher`, `reflex::StdEcmaMatcher`, `reflex::StdPosixMatcher`

The RE/flex `reflex::Matcher` class compiles regex patterns to efficient
non-backtracking deterministic finite state machines (FSM) when instantiated.
These deterministic finite automata (DFA) representations speed up matching
considerably, at the cost of the initial FSM construction (see further below
for hints on how to avoid this run time overhead).  RE/flex matchers only
support POSIX mode matching, see \ref reflex-posix-perl.

The RE/flex `reflex::FuzzyMatcher` class derived from `reflex::Matcher`
supports the same features as the `reflex::Matcher` class but performs
approximate regex pattern matching.  The constructor accepts an optional second
parameter that specifies the "edit distance" for approximate matching.  Pattern
search is not as efficient as the `reflex::Matcher` class that uses SIMD
acceleration to speed up search for the `find()` method.

The `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` and `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher` classes are for
efficient Perl mode matching with PCRE2 using JIT (just-in-time compilation),
where the latter uses native PCRE2 Unicode matching with `PCRE2_UTF+PCRE2_UCP`.
The PCRE2 matchers use JIT optimizations to speed up matching, which comes at a
cost of extra processing when the matcher is instantiated.  The benefit
outweighs the cost when many matches are processed.

The `reflex::BoostMatcher`, `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher`, and
`reflex::BoostPosixMatcher` classes are for default mode, Perl mode, and POSIX
mode matching using the Boost Regex library, respectively.

C++11 std::regex supports ECMAScript and AWK POSIX syntax with the `StdMatcher`
(or `StdEcmaMatcher`) and `reflex::StdPosixMatcher` classes respectively.  The
std::regex syntax is therefore a lot more limited compared to PCRE2,
Boost.Regex, and RE/flex.  These regex matchers are considerably slower
compared to the other matchers.

The RE/flex regex common interface API is implemented in an abstract base class
template `reflex::AbstractMatcher` from which all regex matcher engine classes
are derived.  This regex API offers a uniform common interface.  This interface
is used in the generated scanner.  You can also use this uniform API in your
C++ application for pattern matching with any of the regex libraries without
having to use library-specific API calls to do so.

The RE/flex abstract matcher offers four operations for matching with the regex
engines derived from this base abstract class:

  Method      | Result
  ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `matches()` | returns nonzero if the input from begin to end matches
  `find()`    | search the given input and return nonzero if a match was found
  `scan()`    | return nonzero if input at current position matches partially
  `split()`   | return nonzero for a split of the input at the next match

These methods return a nonzero value for a match, meaning the `size_t accept()`
value that identifies the regex group pattern that matched.  The methods are
repeatable, where the last three return additional matches found when repeated.

For example, to check if a string is a valid date using Boost.Regex:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex

    // use a BoostMatcher to check if the birthdate string is a valid date
    if (reflex::BoostMatcher("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}", birthdate).matches())
      std::cout << "Valid date!" << std::endl;
~~~

We can perform exactly the same check with PCRE2 instead of Boost.Regex:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // use a PCRE2Matcher to check if the birthdate string is a valid date
    if (reflex::PCRE2Matcher("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}", birthdate).matches())
      std::cout << "Valid date!" << std::endl;
~~~

The JIT-optimized PCRE2 matcher is better suited when many matches are
performed on multiple inputs, not just one match as shown above.

Swapping regex libraries is simple.  Sometimes we may need a regex converter
when a regex feature is used that the regex library does not support.

To search a string for all words matching the pattern `\w+`:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // use a PCRE2Matcher to search for words in a sentence
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    Found How
    Found now
    Found brown
    Found cow

If we want to match Unicode words, `\w+` should be converted to a Unicode
pattern, here we convert the pattern for matching with Boost.Regex:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex

    // convert \w+ for Unicode matching
    static const std::string pattern = reflex::BoostMatcher::convert("\\w+", reflex::convert_flag::unicode);

    // use a BoostMatcher to search for words in a sentence
    reflex::BoostMatcher matcher(pattern, "H√∂w n√∂w br√∂wn c√∂w.");
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

Conversion to Unicode patterns is necessary for all matchers except
`reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher`, since matchers operate in non-Unicode mode by
default to match bytes, not wide characters.  We will come back again to
converters later.

When executed this code prints:

    Found H√∂w
    Found n√∂w
    Found br√∂wn
    Found c√∂w

The same code and results are produced with `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` defined in
`reflex/pcre2matcher.h`.  For the following examples we will use Boost.Regex
or PCRE2, which may be used interchangeably.

The `scan` method is similar to the `find` method, but `scan` matches only from
the current position in the input.  It fails when no partial match was possible
at the current position.  Repeately scanning an input source means that matches
must be continuous, otherwise `scan` returns zero (no match).

The `split` method is roughly the inverse of the `find` method and returns text
located between matches.  For example using non-word matching `\W+`:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // use a PCRE2Matcher to search for words in a sentence
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\W+", "How now brown cow.");
    while (matcher.split() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    Found How
    Found now
    Found brown
    Found cow
    Found

Note that split also returns the (possibly empty) remaining text after the last
match, as you can see in the output above: the last split with `\W+` returns an
empty string, which is the remaining input after the period in the sentence.

The `find()`, `scan()` and `split()` methods return a nonzero *"accept"* value,
which corresponds to the regex group captured, or the methods return zero if no
match was found.  The methods return 1 for a match when no groups are used.
The `split()` method has a special case.  It returns the value
`reflex::PCRE2Matcher::Const::EMPTY` (and so does any other matcher) when a
match was made at the end of the input and an empty string was split, as is
the case of the last `split()` match in the example above.

Another example:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // use a PCRE2Matcher to tokenize a string
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("(\\w+)|(\\s+)|(.)", "How now brown cow.");
    size_t accept;
    while ((accept = matcher.scan()) != 0)
    {
      switch (accept)
      {
        case 1: std::cout << "word\n";  break;
        case 2: std::cout << "space\n"; break;
        case 3: std::cout << "other\n"; break;
      }
    }
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    word
    space
    word
    space
    word
    space
    word
    other

The regex engines currently available as classes in the `reflex` namespace are:

  Class                       | Mode  | Engine        | Performance
  --------------------------- | ----- |-------------- | ---------------------------------
  `reflex::Matcher`           | POSIX | RE/flex       | FSM, no backtracking
  `reflex::FuzzyMatcher`      | POSIX | RE/flex       | FSM, minimal backtracking (fuzzy)
  `reflex::PCRE2Matcher`      | Perl  | PCRE2         | JIT-optimized backtracking
  `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher`   | Perl  | PCRE2 UTF+UPC | JIT-optimized backtracking
  `reflex::BoostMatcher`      | Perl  | Boost.Regex   | backtracking
  `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher`  | Perl  | Boost.Regex   | backtracking
  `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher` | POSIX | Boost.Regex   | backtracking
  `reflex::StdMatcher`        | ECMA  | std::regex    | backtracking
  `reflex::StdEcmaMatcher`    | ECMA  | std::regex    | backtracking
  `reflex::StdPosixMatcher`   | POSIX | std::regex    | backtracking

The RE/flex regex engine uses a deterministic finite state machine (FSM) to get
the best performance when matching.  However, constructing a FSM adds overhead.
This matcher is better suitable for searching long texts.  The FSM construction 
overhead can be eliminated by pre-converting the regex to C++ code tables ahead
of time as we will see shortly.  RE/flex fuzzy matching may require minimal
backtracking for approximate pattern matches to find a minimal, but not
necessarily optimal (!), "edit distance" from an exact match.

The PCRE2 engines use Perl mode matching.  PCRE2 also offers POSIX mode
matching with `pcre2_dfa_match()`.  However, group captures are not supported
in this mode.  Therefore, no PCRE2 POSIX mode class is included as a choice.
JIT optimizations speed up matching.  However, this comes at a cost of extra
processing when the PCRE2 matcher class is instantiated.

The Boost.Regex engines normally use Perl mode matching.  We added a POSIX mode
Boost.Regex engine class for the RE/flex scanner generator.  Scanners typically
use POSIX mode matching.  See \ref reflex-posix-perl for more information.

The Boost.Regex engines are all initialized with `match_not_dot_newline`, which
disables dotall matching as the default setting.  Dotall can be re-enabled with
the `(?s)` regex mode modifier.  This is done for compatibility with scanners.

A matcher may be applied to strings and wide strings, such as `std::string` and
`std::wstring`, `char*` and `wchar_t*`.  Wide strings are converted to UTF-8 to
enable matching with regular expressions that contain Unicode patterns.

To match Unicode patterns with regex library engines that are 8-bit based or do
not support Unicode, we want to convert your regex string first before we use
it with a regex matcher engine:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h> // reflex::Matcher, reflex::Input, reflex::Pattern

    // convert a regex with Unicode character classes to create a pattern FSM:
    static const std::string regex = reflex::Matcher::convert("[\\p{Greek}\\p{Zs}\\pP]+", reflex::convert_flag::unicode);
    static const reflex::Pattern pattern(regex);

    // use a Matcher to check if sentence is in Greek:
    if (reflex::Matcher(pattern, sentence).matches())
      std::cout << "This is Greek" << std::endl;
~~~

This converts the Unicode character classes to UTF-8 for matching with an 8-bit
regex engine.  The `convert` static method differs per matcher class.  An error
`reflex::regex_error` is thrown as an exception if conversion was not possible,
which is unlikely, or if the regex is syntactically incorrect.

Conversion is fast (it runs in linear time in the size of the regex), but it is
not without some overhead.  We should make the converted regex patterns
`static` whenever possible, as shown above, to eliminate the cost of repeated
conversions and pattern constructions.

A `reflex::Pattern` object is immutable (it stores a constant table) and may be
shared among threads.

Use `convert` with option `reflex::convert_flag::unicode` to change the meaning
of `.` (dot), `\w`, `\s`, `\l`, `\u`, `\W`, `\S`, `\L`, `\U` character classes.

File contents are streamed into the matcher using partial matching algorithms
and matching happens immediately.  This means that the input does not need to
be loaded as a whole into memory.  This supports interactive matching, i.e.
matching the input from a console:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // use a PCRE2Matcher to search and display words from console input
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", std::cin);
    matcher.interactive();
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

Interactive input is slow to consume due to non-buffered input.

We can also pattern match text from `FILE` descriptors.  The additional benefit
of using `FILE` descriptors is the automatic decoding of UTF-16/32 input to
UTF-8 by the `reflex::Input` class that manages input sources and their state.

For example, pattern matching the content of <i>`"cows.txt"`</i> that may use
UTF-8, 16, or 32 encodings:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // use a PCRE2Matcher to search and display words from a FILE
    FILE *fd = fopen("cows.txt", "r");
    if (fd == NULL)
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", fd);
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

The `find`, `scan`, and `split` methods are also implemented as input iterators
that apply filtering tokenization, and splitting:

  Iterator range                  | Acts as a | Iterates over
  ------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------
  `find.begin()`...`find.end()`   | filter    | all matches
  `scan.begin()`...`scan.end()`   | tokenizer | continuous matches
  `split.begin()`...`split.end()` | splitter  | text between matches

The type `reflex::AbstractMatcher::Operation` is a functor that defines `find`,
`scan`, and `split`.  The functor operation returns true upon success.  The use
of an iterator is simply supported by invoking `begin()` and `end()` methods of
the functor, which return `reflex::AbstractMatcher::iterator`.  Likewise, there
are also `cbegin()` and `cend()` methods that return a `const_iterator`.

We can use these RE/flex iterators in C++ for many tasks, including to populate
containers by stuffing the iterator's text matches into it:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher, reflex::Input
    #include <vector>                // std::vector

    // use a PCRE2UTFMatcher to convert words of a sentence into a string vector
    reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
    std::vector<std::string> words(matcher.find.begin(), matcher.find.end());
~~~

As a result, the `words` vector contains "How", "now", "brown", "cow".

Casting a matcher object to `std::string` is the same as converting `text()` to
a string with `std::string(text(), size())`, which in the example above is done
to construct the `words` vector.  Casting a matcher object to `std::wstring` is
similar, but also converts the UTF-8 `text()` match to a wide string.

RE/flex iterators are useful in C++11 range-based loops.  For example:

~~~{.cpp}
    // Requires C++11, compile with: cc -std=c++11
    #include <reflex/stdmatcher.h> // reflex::StdMatcher, reflex::Input, std::regex

    // use a StdMatcher to search for words in a sentence using an iterator
    reflex::StdMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
    for (auto& match : matcher.find)
      std::cout << "Found " << match.text() << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    Found How
    Found now
    Found brown
    Found cow

And RE/flex iterators are also useful with algorithms and lambdas, for example
to compute a histogram of word frequencies:

~~~{.cpp}
    // Requires C++11, compile with: cc -std=c++11
    #include <reflex/stdmatcher.h> // reflex::StdMatcher, reflex::Input, std::regex
    #include <algorithm>           // std::for_each

    // use a StdMatcher to create a frequency histogram of group captures
    reflex::StdMatcher matcher("(now)|(cow)|(ow)", "How now brown cow.");
    size_t freq[4] = { 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    std::for_each(matcher.find.begin(), matcher.find.end(), [&](size_t n){ ++freq[n]; });
~~~

As a result, the `freq` array contains 0, 1, 1, and 2.

Casting the matcher object to a `size_t` returns the group capture index, which
is used in the example shown above.  We also us it in the example below that is
capturing all regex pattern groupings into a vector:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input
    #include <vector>                // std::vector

    // use a PCRE2Matcher to convert captured groups into a numeric vector
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("(now)|(cow)|(ow)", "How now brown cow.");
    std::vector<size_t> captures(matcher.find.begin(), matcher.find.end());
~~~

As a result, the vector contains the group captures 3, 1, 3, and 2.

Casting the matcher object to `size_t` is the same as invoking `accept()`.

This method and other methods may be used to obtain the details of a match:

  Method          | Result
  --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `accept()`      | returns group capture index (or zero if not captured/matched)
  `text()`        | returns `const char*` to 0-terminated match (ends in `\0`)
  `strview()`     | returns `std::string_view` text match (preserves `\0`s) (C++17)
  `str()`         | returns `std::string` text match (preserves `\0`s)
  `wstr()`        | returns `std::wstring` wide text match (converted from UTF-8)
  `chr()`         | returns first 8-bit char of the text match (`str()[0]` as int)
  `wchr()`        | returns first wide char of the text match (`wstr()[0]` as int)
  `pair()`        | returns `std::pair<size_t,std::string>(accept(),str())`
  `wpair()`       | returns `std::pair<size_t,std::wstring>(accept(),wstr())`
  `size()`        | returns the length of the text match in bytes
  `wsize()`       | returns the length of the match in number of wide characters
  `lines()`       | returns the number of lines in the text match (>=1)
  `columns()`     | returns the number of columns of the text match (>=0)
  `begin()`       | returns `const char*` to non-0-terminated text match begin
  `end()`         | returns `const char*` to non-0-terminated text match end
  `rest()`        | returns `const char*` to 0-terminated rest of input
  `span()`        | returns `const char*` to 0-terminated match enlarged to span the line
  `line()`        | returns `std::string` line with the matched text as a substring
  `wline()`       | returns `std::wstring` line with the matched text as a substring
  `more()`        | tells the matcher to append the next match (when using `scan()`)
  `less(n)`       | cuts `text()` to `n` bytes and repositions the matcher
  `lineno()`      | returns line number of the match, starting at line 1
  `columno()`     | returns column number of the match in characters, starting at 0
  `lineno_end()`  | returns ending line number of the match, starting at line 1
  `columno_end()` | returns ending column number of the match, starting at 0
  `bol()`         | returns `const char*` to begin of matching line (not 0-terminated)
  `border()`      | returns the byte offset from the start of the line of the match
  `first()`       | returns input position of the first character of the match
  `last()`        | returns input position + 1 of the last character of the match
  `at_bol()`      | true if matcher reached the begin of a new line `\n`
  `at_bob()`      | true if matcher is at the begin of input and no input consumed
  `at_end()`      | true if matcher is at the end of input
  `[0]`           | operator returns `std::pair<const char*,size_t>(begin(),size())`
  `[n]`           | operator returns n'th capture `std::pair<const char*,size_t>`

For a detailed explanation of these methods, see \ref regex-methods-props.

The `operator[n]` takes the group number `n` and returns the n'th group capture
match as a pair with a `const char*` pointer to the group-matching text and the
size of the matched text in bytes.  Because the pointer points to a string that
is not 0-terminated, use the size to determine the matching part.

The pointer is `NULL` when the group capture has no match.

For example:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // a PCRE2Matcher to capture name and number:
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("(\\w+)\\s+(\\d+)");

    // use the matcher on a string:
    if (matcher.input("cow 123").matches())
      std::cout <<
        "name: " << std::string(matcher[1].first, matcher[1].second) <<
        ", number: " << std::string(matcher[2].first, matcher[2].second) <<
        std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    name: cow, number: 123

@warning The `text()` method returns the match by pointing to the `const char*`
string that is stored in an internal buffer.  This pointer *should not be used*
after matching continues and when the matcher object is deallocated.  To retain
the `text()` value we recommend to use the `str()` method that returns a copy
of `text()`.  Likewise, the `strview()` method returns the same `text()`
pointer and should not be used after matching continues.

@warning The `operator[]` method returns a pair with the match info of the n'th
group, which is a non-0-terminated `const char*` pointer (or NULL) and its size
in bytes of the captured match.  The string *should not be used* after matching
continues.

@note When using the `reflex::Matcher` class, the `accept()` method returns the
accepted pattern among the alternations in the regex that are specified only at
the top level in the regex.  For example, the regex `"(a(b)c)|([A-Z])"` has two
groups, because only the outer top-level groups are recognized.  Because groups
are specified at the top level only, the grouping parenthesis are optional.  We
can simplify the regex to `"a(b)c|[A-Z]"` and still capture the two patterns.

The following methods may be used to manipulate the input stream directly:

  Method     | Result
  ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------
  `input()`  | returns next 8-bit char from the input, matcher then skips it
  `winput()` | returns next wide character from the input, matcher skips it
  `unput(c)` | put 8-bit char `c` back unto the stream, matcher then takes it
  `wunput(c)`| put (wide) char `c` back unto the stream, matcher then takes it
  `peek()`   | returns next 8-bit char from the input without consuming it
  `skip(c)`  | skip input until character `c` (`char` or `wchar_t`) is consumed
  `skip(s)`  | skip input until UTF-8 string `s` is consumed
  `rest()`   | returns the remaining input as a 0-terminated `char*` string

The `input()`, `winput()`, and `peek()` methods return a non-negative character
code and EOF (-1) when the end of input is reached.

To initialize a matcher for interactive use, to assign a new input source or to
change its pattern, use the following methods:

  Method          | Result
  --------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------
  `input(i)`      | set input to `reflex::Input i` (string, stream, or `FILE*`)
  `pattern(p)`    | set pattern `reflex::Pattern`, `boost::regex`, or a string `p`
  `has_pattern()` | true if the matcher has a pattern assigned to it
  `own_pattern()` | true if the matcher has a pattern to manage and delete
  `pattern()`     | a reference to the pattern object
  `buffer()`      | buffer all input at once, returns true if successful
  `buffer(n)`     | set the buffer size to `n` bytes to buffer input
  `buffer(b, n)`  | use buffer of `n` bytes at address `b` with to a string of `n`-1 bytes (zero copy)
  `interactive()` | set buffer size to 1 for console-based (TTY) input
  `flush()`       | flush the remaining input from the internal buffer
  `reset()`       | resets the matcher, restarting it from the remaining input
  `reset(o)`      | resets the matcher with new options string `o` ("A?N?T?")

A `reflex::Input` object represents the source of input for a matcher, which is
either a file `FILE*`, or a string (with UTF-8 character data) of `const char*`
or `std::string` type, or a stream pointer `std::istream*`. The `reflex::Input`
object is implicitly constructed from one of these input sources, for example:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // set the input source to a string (or a stream or a FILE*)
    reflex::Input source = "How now brown cow.";

    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", source);

    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;

    // use the same matcher with a new source (an Input object):
    std::ifstream ifs("cows.txt", std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);
    source = ifs;           // Input source is reassignable
    matcher.input(source);  // can use ifs as parameter also

    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;

    ifs.close();
~~~

The entire input is buffered in a matcher with `buffer()`, or is read piecemeal
with `buffer(n)`, or is read interactively with `interactive()`.  These methods
should be used after setting the input source.  Reading a stream with buffering
all input data at once is done with the `>>` operator as a shortcut:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    // read and buffer cows.txt file
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\<cow\>");
    std::ifstream cows("cows.txt", std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);
    cows >> matcher;     // same as matcher.input(cows).buffer();
    cows.close();        // can already close now because stream content is stored

    // count number of 'cow' words:
    std::out << std::distance(matcher.find.begin(), matcher.find.end()) << " 'cow' in cows.txt\n";
~~~

Zero-copy overhead is achieved by specifying `buffer(b, n)` to read `n`-1 bytes
located at address `b` for in-place matching, where bytes `b[0...n]` are
possibly modified by the matcher:

~~~{.cpp}
    // search data in place, data content is changed with text()!!
    char *base = ...;  // points to the base address of the data
    size_t size = ...; // length of the data including one extra byte for a final \0
    matcher.buffer(base, size);
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

@warning `buffer(b, n)` specifies `n`-1 bytes at address `b`.  The length `n`
should include one extra byte that can be modified.

@note The final byte of the specified data will be set to zero when `text()` or
`rest()` are used.  Only `unput(c)`, `wunput()`, `text()`, `rest()`, and
`span()` modify the buffer contents, because these functions require an extra
byte at the end of the buffer to make the strings returned by these methods
0-terminated.  This means that we can specify read-only memory of `n` bytes
located at address `b` by using `buffer(b, n+1)` safely as long as we do not
use `unput()`, `unput()`, `text()`, `rest()`, and `span()`, for example to
search read-only mmap(2) `PROT_READ` memory.

So far we explained how to use `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` and
`reflex::BoostMatcher` for pattern matching.  We can also use the RE/flex
`reflex::Matcher` class for pattern matching.  The API is exactly the same.
The `reflex::Matcher` class uses `reflex::Pattern`, which internally represents
an efficient finite state machine that is compiled from a regex.  These state
machines are used for fast matching.

The construction of deterministic finite state machines (FSMs) is optimized but
can take some time and therefore adds overhead before matching can start.  This
FSM construction should not be executed repeatedly if it can be avoided.  So we
recommend to construct static pattern objects to create the FSMs only once:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h> // reflex::Matcher, reflex::Pattern, reflex::Input

    // statically allocate and construct a pattern, i.e. once and for all
    static reflex::Pattern word_pattern("\\w+");

    // use the RE/flex POSIX matcher to search for words in a string sentence
    reflex::Matcher matcher(word_pattern, "How now brown cow.");
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

A `reflex::Pattern` object is immutable (it stores a constant table) and may be
shared among threads.

The RE/flex matcher only supports POSIX mode matching and does not support Perl
mode matching.  See \ref reflex-posix-perl for more information.

The RE/flex `reflex::Pattern` class has several options that control the regex.
Options and modes for the regex are set as a string, for example:

~~~{.cpp}
    static reflex::Pattern word_pattern("\\w+", "f=graph.gv;f=machine.cpp");
~~~

The `f=graph.gv` option emits a Graphviz <i>`.gv`</i> file that can be visually
rendered with the open source [Graphviz dot tool](http://www.graphviz.org) by
converting the deterministic finite state machine (FSM) to PDF, PNG, or other
formats:

@dot
digraph FSM {
                size="3,3";
                rankdir=LR;
                concentrate=true;
                node [fontname="ArialNarrow"];
                edge [fontname="Courier"];

                init [root=true,peripheries=0,label="",fontname="Courier"];
                init -> N0x7fff57feb0d0;

/*START*/       N0x7fff57feb0d0 [label=""];
                N0x7fff57feb0d0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="0-9"];
                N0x7fff57feb0d0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="A-Z"];
                N0x7fff57feb0d0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="_"];
                N0x7fff57feb0d0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="a-z"];

/*ACCEPT 1*/    N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="[1]",peripheries=2];
                N0x7fef78c03cb0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="0-9"];
                N0x7fef78c03cb0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="A-Z"];
                N0x7fef78c03cb0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="_"];
                N0x7fef78c03cb0 -> N0x7fef78c03cb0 [label="a-z"];
}
@enddot

The `f=machine.cpp` option emits opcode tables for the FSM to match regular
expressions efficiently.  The FSM matcher engine runs as a virtual machine to
execute opcodes without backtracking.  In this case we get the following FSM
table with eleven code words:

~~~{.cpp}
    REFLEX_CODE_DECL reflex_code_FSM[11] =
    {
      0x617A0005, // 0: GOTO 5 ON a-z
      0x5F5F0005, // 1: GOTO 5 ON _
      0x415A0005, // 2: GOTO 5 ON A-Z
      0x30390005, // 3: GOTO 5 ON 0-9
      0x00FFFFFF, // 4: HALT
      0xFF000001, // 5: TAKE 1
      0x617A0005, // 6: GOTO 5 ON a-z
      0x5F5F0005, // 7: GOTO 5 ON _
      0x415A0005, // 8: GOTO 5 ON A-Z
      0x30390005, // 9: GOTO 5 ON 0-9
      0x00FFFFFF, // 10: HALT
    };
~~~

Option `o` may be used with `f=machine.cpp` to emit optimized native C++ code
for the FSM that gnerally runs faster than running the virtual machine on
opcode tables:

~~~{.cpp}
    void reflex_code_FSM(reflex::Matcher& m)
    {
      int c = 0;
      m.FSM_INIT(c);

    S0:
      c = m.FSM_CHAR();
      if (97 <= c && c <= 122) goto S5;
      if (c == 95) goto S5;
      if (65 <= c && c <= 90) goto S5;
      if (48 <= c && c <= 57) goto S5;
      return m.FSM_HALT(c);

    S5:
      m.FSM_TAKE(1);
      c = m.FSM_CHAR();
      if (97 <= c && c <= 122) goto S5;
      if (c == 95) goto S5;
      if (65 <= c && c <= 90) goto S5;
      if (48 <= c && c <= 57) goto S5;
      return m.FSM_HALT(c);
    }
~~~

The compact FSM opcode tables or the optimized FSM code may be used directly in
your code.  This omits the FSM construction overhead at runtime.  Simply
include this generated file in your source code and pass it on to the
`reflex::Pattern` constructor:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h>   // reflex::Matcher, reflex::Pattern, reflex::Input
    #include "machine.cpp" // reflex_code_FSM[]

    // use the pattern FSM (opcode table or C++ code) for fast search
    static reflex::Pattern pattern(reflex_code_FSM);

    // use the RE/flex POSIX matcher to search for words in a string sentence
    reflex::Matcher matcher(pattern, "How now brown cow.");
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

The RE/flex `reflex::Pattern` construction options are given as a string:

  Option        | Effect
  ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------
  `b`           | bracket lists are parsed without converting escapes
  `e=c;`        | redefine the escape character
  `f=file.cpp;` | save finite state machine code to `file.cpp`
  `f=file.gv;`  | save deterministic finite state machine to `file.gv`
  `i`           | case-insensitive matching, same as `(?i)X`
  `m`           | multiline mode, same as `(?m)X`
  `n=name;`     | use `reflex_code_name` for the machine (instead of `FSM`)
  `o`           | only with option `f`: generate optimized FSM native C++ code
  `q`           | Flex/Lex-style quotations "..." equal `\Q...\E`, same as `(?q)X`
  `r`           | throw regex syntax error exceptions, otherwise ignore errors
  `s`           | dot matches all (aka. single line mode), same as `(?s)X`
  `x`           | free space mode with inline comments, same as `(?x)X`
  `w`           | display regex syntax errors before raising them as exceptions

For example, `reflex::Pattern pattern(pattern, "isr")` enables case-insensitive
dot-all matching with syntax errors thrown as `reflex::Pattern::Error` types of
exceptions.  By default, the `reflex::Pattern` constructor solely throws the
`reflex::regex_error::exceeds_length` and `reflex::regex_error::exceeds_limits`
exceptions and silently ignores syntax errors, see \ref regex-pattern.

In summary:

- RE/flex defines an extensible abstract class interface that offers a standard
  API to use regex matcher engines.  The API is used by the generated scanners.
  The API supports UTF-8/16/32-encoded FILE content, wide strings and streaming
  data.

- RE/flex includes a regex matcher class and a regex pattern class to implement
  fast matching with deterministic finite state machines (FSMs).  The FSM graph
  can be visualized with the Graphviz dot tool.  Furthermore, this FSM can also
  be exported and imported as source code to expedite pattern matching.

\ref regex section has more information about the RE/flex regex library.

The RE/flex scanner generator                                         {#reflex}
=============================

The RE/flex scanner generator <b>`reflex`</b> takes a lexer specification and
generates a regex-based C++ lexer class that is saved to <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i>,
or saved to the file we specified by the `-o` command-line option.  This file
is then compiled and linked with option `-lreflex` (and optionally
`-lboost_regex` if we use Boost.Regex for matching or `-lpcre2-8` if we use
PCRE2 for matching) to produce a scanner:

    reflex lexerspec.l
    c++ lex.yy.cpp -lreflex

We use option `‚àí‚àíheader-file` to generate <i>`lex.yy.h`</i> to include in the
source code of your lexer application:

    reflex ‚àí‚àíheader-file=lexerspec.l
    c++ mylexer.cpp lex.yy.cpp -lreflex

If `libreflex` was not installed then linking with `-lreflex` fails.  See
\ref link-errors on how to resolve this.

The scanner can be a stand-alone application based on <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i>
alone, or be part of a larger program, such as a compiler:

@dot
digraph build {
  ranksep=.25;
  node     [ shape=box, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=11 ];
  spec     [ label="lexer specification\n(.l)", peripheries=0 ];
  reflex   [ label="reflex scanner generator" ];
  lexyycpp [ label="lexer class\n(lex.yy.cpp)", peripheries=0 ];
  cpp      [ label="C++ compiler & linker" ];
  scanner  [ label="scanner\n(a.out)", peripheries=0 ];
  libs     [ label="libraries\n(libreflex, libboost_regex, libpcre2-8)", peripheries=0 ];
  incs     [ label="option --header-file\n(lex.yy.h)", peripheries=0 ];
  spec -> reflex -> lexyycpp -> cpp -> scanner;
  incs -> cpp;
  libs -> cpp;
}
@enddot

The RE/flex-generated scanners use the RE/flex regex library API for pattern
matching.  The RE/flex regex library API is defined by the abstract class
`reflex::AbstractMatcher`.

There are three regex matching engines to choose from for the generated scanner:
the Boost.Regex library, the PCRE2 linrary, or the built-in RE/flex POSIX
matcher engine.  In any case, the `libreflex` library should be linked.
The `libboost_regex` library or the `libpcre2-8` library should only be linked
when the Boost.Regex or PCRE2 engines are used for matching, respectively.

The input class `reflex::Input` of the `libreflex` library manages input from
strings, wide strings, streams, and data from `FILE` descriptors.  File data
may be encoded in ASCII, binary or in UTF-8/16/32.  UTF-16/32 is automatically
decoded and converted to UTF-8 for UTF-8-based regex matching:

@dot
digraph execute {
  ranksep=.25;
  node     [ shape=box, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=11 ];
  string   [ label="string/buffer input\n(ASCII, binary, UTF-8)", peripheries=0 ];
  wstring  [ label="wide string input\n(UCS-4)", peripheries=0 ];
  file     [ label="FILE input\n(ASCII, binary, UTF-8/16/32)", peripheries=0 ];
  istream  [ label="istream input\n(cin, fstream, etc.)", peripheries=0 ];
  aout     [ label="scanner\n(a.out)" ];
  actions  [ label="actions & tokens", peripheries=0 ];
  string  -> aout -> actions;
  wstring -> aout;
  file    -> aout;
  istream -> aout;
}
@enddot

The generated scanner executes actions (typically to produce tokens for a
parser).  The actions are triggered by matching patterns to the input.

The reflex command line tool                                  {#reflex-command}
----------------------------

The <b>`reflex`</b> command takes a lexer specification from standard input or
from the specified file (usually with extension <i>`.l`</i>, <i>`.ll`</i>,
<i>`.l++`</i>, <i>`.lxx`</i>, or <i>`.lpp`</i>) and generates a C++ scanner
class that is saved to the <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i> source code file.

The <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i> source code output is structured in sections that are
clean, readable, and reusable.

Use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíheader-file` to generate <i>`lex.yy.h`</i> to
include in the source code of your application:

    reflex ‚àí‚àíheader-file=lexerspec.l

The <b>`reflex`</b> command accepts `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` options for
compatibility with Flex and Bison/Yacc, respectively.  These options allow
<b>`reflex`</b> to be used as a replacement of the classic Flex and Lex tools:

    reflex ‚àí‚àíflex ‚àí‚àíbison lexerspec.l

The first option `‚àí‚àíflex` specifies that <i>`lexerspec.l`</i> is a classic
Flex/Lex specification with `yytext` or `YYText()` and the usual "yy" variables
and functions.

The second option `‚àí‚àíbison` generates a scanner class and the usual global "yy"
variables and functions such as `yytext`, `yyleng`, `yylineno`, and `yylex()`
for compatibility with non-reentrant Bison parsers.  See \ref reflex-bison for
more details on Bison parsers that are reentrant and/or use bison-bridge and
bison-locations options.  For Bison 3.0 C++ parsers, use `‚àí‚àíbison-cc` and
optionally `‚àí‚àíbison-locations`.

Option `‚àí‚àíyy` enables both `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` and maximizes compatibility
with Lex/Flex by generating the global `yyin` and `yyout` variables and global
`yy` functions.  Otherwise, `yyin` points to a `reflex::Input` object for
advanced input handling, which is more powerful than the traditional `FILE*`
type `yyin`.

Options                                                       {#reflex-options}
-------

To control the output of the <b>`reflex`</b> scanner generator use the
command-line options described in the next subsections.  These options can also
be specified in the lexer specification with <i>`%%option`</i> or <i>`%%o`</i>
for short, for example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option flex
    %option bison
    %option graphs-file=mygraph.gv
~~~
</div>

The above is equivalent to the `‚àí‚àíflex`, `‚àí‚àíbison`, and
`‚àí‚àígraphs-file=mygraph.gv` command-line options.

Multiple options can be grouped on a single line:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %o flex bison graphs-file=mygraph.gv
~~~
</div>

An option parameter name may contain hyphens (-), dots (.), and double colons
(::).  Flex always requires quotes with option parameters, but RE/flex does
not require quotes except when special characters are used, for example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %o flex bison graphs-file="dev/output/mygraph.gv"
~~~
</div>

Quotes (") and backslashes (\\) should be escaped in an option parameter:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %o flex bison graphs-file="D:\\dev\\output\\mygraph.gv"
~~~
</div>

Shorter forms may be used by omitting <i>`%%o`</i> altogether, requiring each
option to be specified on a separate line:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %flex
    %bison
    %graphs-file="dev/output/mygraph.gv"
~~~
</div>

Options that affect the regular expressions such as <i>`%%option unicode`</i>
and <i>`%%option dotall`</i> should be specified before any regular expressions
are defined and used in the specification.

The scanner code generated by <b>`reflex`</b> defines options as macros
`REFLEX_OPTION_name` with a value of `true` when the option is enabled or with
the value that is assigned to the option.  This allows your program code to
check and use RE/flex options.  For example, the lexer class name is
`REFLEX_OPTION_lexer` when the lexer class name is redefined with command-line
option `‚àí‚àílexer=NAME` or in the lexer specification with
<i>`%%option lexer=NAME`</i>.

### Scanner options                                   {#reflex-options-scanner}

#### `‚àí+`, `‚àí‚àíflex`

This option generates a `yyFlexLexer` scanner class that is compatible with the
Flex-generated `yyFlexLexer` scanner class (assuming Flex with option `‚àí+` for
C++).  The generated `yyFlexLexer` class has the usual `yytext` and other "yy"
variables and functions, as defined by the Flex specification standard.  Without
this option, RE/flex actions should be used that are lexer class methods such
as `text()`, `echo()` and also the lexer's matcher methods, such as
`matcher().more()`, see \ref reflex-spec-rules for more details.

#### `-a`, `‚àí‚àídotall`

This option makes dot (`.`) in patterns match newline.  Normally dot matches a
single character except a newline (`\n` ASCII 0x0A).

#### `-B`, `‚àí‚àíbatch`

This option generates a batch input scanner that reads the entire input all at
once when possible.  This scanner is fast, but consumes more memory depending
on the input data size.  An option argument may be specified to initialize
the buffer size to support incremental scanning by reading chunks of input, for
example `‚àí‚àíbatch=1024` reads the input in 1024 byte chunks.

#### `-f`, `‚àí‚àífull`

(RE/flex matcher only).  This option adds the FSM to the generated code as a
static opcode table, thus generating the scanner in full.  FSM construction
overhead is eliminated when the scanner is initialized, resulting in a scanner
that starts scanning the input immediately.  This option has no effect when
option `‚àí‚àífast` is specified.

#### `-F`, `‚àí‚àífast`

(RE/flex matcher only).  This option adds the FSM to the generated code as
optimized native C++ code.  FSM construction overhead is eliminated when the
scanner is initialized, resulting in a scanner that starts scanning the input
immediately.  The generated code takes more space compared to the `‚àí‚àífull`
option.

#### `-S`, `‚àí‚àífind`

This option generates a search engine to find pattern matches to invoke actions
corresponding to matching patterns.  Unmatched input is ignored.  By contrast,
option `-s` (or `‚àí‚àínodefault`) produces an error when non-matching input is
found.

#### `-i`, `‚àí‚àícase-insensitive`

This option ignores case in patterns.  Patterns match lower and upper case
letters in the ASCII range only.

#### `-I`, `‚àí‚àíinteractive`, `‚àí‚àíalways-interactive`

This option generates an interactive scanner and permits console input by
sacrificing speed.  This optiong is essentially the same as `‚àí‚àíbatch=1` to
consume one character at a time.  By contrast, the default buffered input
strategy is more efficient.

#### `‚àí‚àíindent` and `‚àí‚àínoindent`

This option enables or disables support for indentation matching with anchors
`\i`, `\j`, and `\k`.  Indentation matching is enabled by default.  Matching
speed may be improved by disabling indentation matching, but should only be
disabled when none of the indentation anchors is used in any of the patterns.

#### `-m reflex`, `‚àí‚àímatcher=reflex`

This option generates a scanner that uses the RE/flex `reflex::Matcher` class
with a POSIX matcher engine.  This is the default matcher for scanning.  This
option is best for Flex compatibility.  This matcher supports lazy quantifiers,
\ref reflex-pattern-unicode, \ref reflex-pattern-anchor,
\ref reflex-pattern-dents matching, and supports FSM output for visualization
with Graphviz.

#### `-m boost`, `‚àí‚àímatcher=boost`

This option generates a scanner that uses the `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher` class
with a Boost.Regex POSIX matcher engine for scanning.  The matcher supports
Unicode, word boundary anchors, and more, but not lazy quantifiers.  Graphviz
output is not supported.

#### `-m boost-perl`, `‚àí‚àímatcher=boost-perl`

This option generates a scanner that uses the `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher` class
with a Boost.Regex normal (Perl) matcher engine for scanning.  The matching
behavior differs from the POSIX *leftmost longest rule* and results in the
first matching rule to be applied instead of the rule that produces the longest
match.  Graphviz output is not supported.

#### `-m pcre2-perl`, `‚àí‚àímatcher=pcre2-perl`

This option generates a scanner that uses the `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` class
with a PCRE2 (Perl) matcher engine for scanning.  The matching behavior differs
from the POSIX *leftmost longest rule* and results in the first matching rule
to be applied instead of the rule that produces the longest match.  Graphviz
output is not supported.

#### `‚àí‚àípattern=NAME`

This option defines a custom pattern class `NAME` for the custom matcher
specified with option `-m`.

#### `‚àí‚àíinclude=FILE`

This option defines a custom include <i>`FILE.h`</i> to include for the custom
matcher specified with option `-m`.

#### `-T N`, `‚àí‚àítabs=N`

This option sets the tab size to `N`, where `N` can be set to 1 (no expansion),
2, 4, or 8.  The default tab size is 8.  The tab size determines the column
position for \ref reflex-pattern-dents matching and to determine the column
position returned by `columno()`, `columno_end()`, and the number of columns
returned by `columns()`.  It has no effect otherwise.  This option assigns the
`T=N` value of the `reflex::Matcher` constructor options at runtime.  The value
may be set at runtime with `matcher().tabs(N)` with `N` 1, 2, 4, or 8.

#### `-u`, `‚àí‚àíunicode`

This option makes `.`, `\s`, `\w`, `\l`, `\u`, `\S`, `\W`, `\L`, `\U` match
Unicode.  Also groups UTF-8 sequences in the regex, such that each UTF-8
encoded character in a regex is properly matched as one wide character.

#### `-x`, `‚àí‚àífreespace`

This option switches the <b>`reflex`</b> scanner to *free space mode*.  Regular
expressions in free space mode may contain spacing and may be indented to
improve readability.  All spacing before, within and after regular expressions
is ignored.  To match a space use `" "` or `[ ]`, and use `\h` to match a space
or a tab character.  Actions in free space mode MUST be placed in <i>`{ }`</i>
blocks and user code must be placed in <i>`%{ %}`</i> blocks.  Patterns ending
in an escape `\` continue on the next line.

### Output files options                                {#reflex-options-files}

#### `-o FILE`, `‚àí‚àíoutfile=FILE`

This option saves the scanner to `FILE` instead of <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i>.

#### `-t`, `‚àí‚àístdout`

This option writes the scanner to stdout instead of to <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i>.

#### `‚àí‚àígraphs-file[=FILE[.gv]]`

(RE/flex matcher only).  This option generates a Graphviz file
<i>`FILE.gv`</i>, where `FILE` is optional.  When `FILE` is omitted the
<b>`reflex`</b> command generates the file <i>`reflex.S.gv`</i> for each start
condition state <i>`S`</i> defined in the lexer specification.  This includes
<i>`reflex.INITIAL.gv`</i> for the <i>`INITIAL`</i> start condition state.
This option can be used to visualize the RE/flex matcher's finite state machine
with the [Graphviz dot](http://www.graphviz.org) tool.  For example:

@dot
digraph INITIAL {
                size="7,7";
                rankdir=LR;
                concentrate=true;
                node [fontname="ArialNarrow"];
                edge [fontname="Courier"];

                init [root=true,peripheries=0,label="INITIAL",fontname="Courier"];
                init -> N0x7fff52a39300;

/*START*/       N0x7fff52a39300 [label=""];
                N0x7fff52a39300 -> N0x7f947940ebf0 [label="\\0-#"];
                N0x7fff52a39300 -> N0x7f947940ecb0 [label="$"];
                N0x7fff52a39300 -> N0x7f947940ebf0 [label="%-\\xff"];

/*ACCEPT 2*/    N0x7f947940ebf0 [label="[2]",peripheries=2];

/*ACCEPT 2*/    N0x7f947940ecb0 [label="[2]",peripheries=2];
                N0x7f947940ecb0 -> N0x7f947940ee30 [label="0-9"];

/*ACCEPT 1*/    N0x7f947940ee30 [label="[1]",peripheries=2];
                N0x7f947940ee30 -> N0x7f947940ef50 [label="."];
                N0x7f947940ee30 -> N0x7f947940ee30 [label="0-9"];

/*STATE*/       N0x7f947940ef50 [label=""];
                N0x7f947940ef50 -> N0x7f947940f070 [label="0-9"];

/*STATE*/       N0x7f947940f070 [label=""];
                N0x7f947940f070 -> N0x7f947940f150 [label="0-9"];

/*ACCEPT 1*/    N0x7f947940f150 [label="[1]",peripheries=2];
}
@enddot

In case you are curious: the specification for this FSM digraph has two
patterns: [1] a pattern to match dollar amounts with the regex
`\$\d+(\.\d{2})?` and [2] the regex `.|\n` to skip a character and advance to
the next match.

#### `‚àí‚àíheader-file[=FILE]`

This option generates a C++ header file <i>`FILE`</i> that declares the lexer
class, in addition to the generated lexer class code, where `FILE` is optional.
When `FILE` is omitted the <b>`reflex`</b> command generates <i>`lex.yy.h`</i>.

#### `‚àí‚àíregexp-file[=FILE[.txt]]`

This option generates a text file <i>`FILE.txt`</i> that contains the scanner's
regular expression patterns, where `FILE` is optional.  When `FILE` is omitted
the <b>`reflex`</b> command generates <i>`reflex.S.txt`</i> for each start
condition state <i>`S`</i>.  The regular expression patterns are converted from
the lexer specification and translated into valid C++ strings that can be used
with a regex library for pattern matching.

#### `‚àí‚àítables-file[=FILE[.cpp]]`

(RE/flex matcher only).  This option generates a C++ file <i>`FILE.cpp`</i>
with the finite state machine in source code form, where `FILE` is optional.
When `FILE` is omitted the <b>`reflex`</b> command generates
<i>`reflex.S.cpp`</i> for each start condition state <i>`S`</i>.  This includes
the file <i>`reflex.INITIAL.cpp`</i> for the <i>`INITIAL`</i> start condition
state.  When this option is specified in combination with `‚àí‚àífull` or `‚àí‚àífast`,
the `reflex::Pattern` is instantiated with the code table defined in this file.
Therefore, when we combine this option with `‚àí‚àífull` or `‚àí‚àífast` then you
should compile the generated table file with the scanner.  Options `‚àí‚àífull` and
`‚àí‚àífast` eliminate the FSM construction overhead when the scanner is
initialized.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Output code options                                  {#reflex-options-code}

#### `‚àí‚àínamespace=NAME`

This option places the generated scanner class in the C++ namespace `NAME`
scope, that is `NAME::Lexer` (and `NAME::yyFlexLexer` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is
used).  `NAME` can be a list of nested namespaces of the form
`NAME1::NAME2::NAME3` ...  or by using a dot as in `NAME1.NAME2.NAME3` ...

#### `‚àí‚àílexer=NAME`

This option defines the `NAME` of the generated scanner class and replaces the
default name `Lexer` (and replaces `yyFlexLexer` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is
specified).  The scanner class members may be declared within a
<i>`%%class{ }`</i> block.  The scanner class constructor code may be defined
within a <i>`%%init{ }`</i> block.  Additional constructor arguments may be
declared with <i>`%%option ctorarg="argument, argument, ..."`</i> and
initializers with <i>`%%option ctorinit="initializer, initializer, ..."`</i>.

#### `‚àí‚àílex=NAME`

This option defines the `NAME` of the generated scanner function to replace the
function name `lex()` (and `yylex()` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified).

#### `‚àí‚àíparams="TYPE NAME, ..."`

This option defines additional parameters for the `lex()` scanner function (and
`yylex()` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified).  The function signature is
extended to include the comma-separated `TYPE NAME` parameters.  This mechanism
replaces Flex `YY_DECL`, see \ref YYDECL.

#### `‚àí‚àíclass=NAME`

This option defines the `NAME` of the user-defined scanner class that should be
derived from the generated base `Lexer` class.  Use this option when defining
your own scanner class named `NAME`.  You can declare your custom lexer class
in the first section of the lexer specification.  Because the custom lexer
class is user-defined, <b>`reflex`</b> generates the implementation of the
`lex()` scanner function for this specified class.

#### `‚àí‚àíyyclass=NAME`

This option combines options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíclass=NAME`.

#### `‚àí‚àímain`

This option generates a `main` function to create a stand-alone scanner that
scans data from standard input (using `stdin`).

#### `-L`, `‚àí‚àínoline`

This option suppresses the `#line` directives in the generated scanner code.

#### `-P NAME`, `‚àí‚àíprefix=NAME`

This option specifies `NAME` as a prefix for the generated `yyFlexLexer` class
to replace the default `yy` prefix.  Also renames the prefix of `yylex()`.
Generates <i>`lex.NAME.cpp`</i> file instead of <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i>, and
generates <i>`lex.NAME.h`</i> with option `‚àí‚àíheader-file`.

#### `‚àí‚àínostdinit`

This option initializes input to `std::cin` instead of `stdin`, if no input was
assigned to the scanner.  This option also prevents a scanner to automatically
read `stdin` before any other input is assigned, when detecting UTF encodings
on standard input.  Note that automatic UTF decoding is not supported on
`std::cin`.  Use `stdin` for automatic UTF BOM detection and UTF decoding of
standard input streams, not `std::cin`.

#### `‚àí‚àíbison`

This option generates a scanner that works with Bison parsers, by defining
global (i.e. non-thread-safe and non-reentrant) "yy" variables and functions,
such as `yytext`, `yyleng`, `yylineno`, and `yylex()`.  See \ref reflex-bison
for more details.  Use option `‚àí‚àínoyywrap` to remove the dependency on the
global `yywrap()` function.  Use option `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` to support the
Bison <i>`%%locations`</i> feature.  See also the `‚àí‚àíyy` option.

#### `‚àí‚àíbison-bridge`

This option generates a scanner that works with Bison pure (reentrant
thead-safe) parsers using a Bison bridge for one ore more scanner objects.
Combine this option with `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` to support the Bison
<i>`%%locations`</i> feature.  See \ref reflex-bison-bridge for more details.

#### `‚àí‚àíbison-cc`

This option generates a scanner that works with Bison 3.0
<i>`%%skeleton "lalr1.cc"`</i> C++ parsers that are thread-safe.  Combine this
option with `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` to support the Bison <i>`%%locations`</i>
grammar.  See \ref reflex-bison-cc for more details.

#### `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME`

This option specifies one or more `NAME` namespace(s) for the Bison 3.0
<i>`%%skeleton "lalr1.cc"`</i> C++ parser, which is `yy` by default.

#### `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser=NAME`

This option specifies the class `NAME` of the Bison 3.0
<i>`%%skeleton "lalr1.cc"`</i> C++ parser, which is `parser` by default.

#### `‚àí‚àíbison-complete`

This option generates a ascnner that works with Bison 3.2 C++ complete symbols,
specified by <i>`%%define api.value.type variant`</i> and
<i>`%%define api.token.constructor`</i> in a Bison grammar file.  This option
also sets option `‚àí‚àíbison-cc` and sets `‚àí‚àítoken-type` to the parser's
`symbol_type`, and sets `‚àí‚àítoken-eof` to `0`, assuming these options are not
specified already.  Combine this option with `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` to support the
Bison <i>`%%locations`</i> feature.  See \ref reflex-bison-complete for more
details.

#### `‚àí‚àíbison-locations`

This option generates a scanner that works with Bison with locations enabled.
See \ref reflex-bison-locations for more details.

#### `-R`, `‚àí‚àíreentrant`

This option generates additional Flex-compatible `yylex()` reentrant scanner
functions.  RE/flex scanners are always reentrant, assuming that
<i>`%%class`</i> variables are used instead of the user declaring global
variables.  This is a Flex-compatibility option and should only be used with
options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison`.  With this option enabled, most Flex functions
take a `yyscan_t` scanner as an extra last argument.  See \ref reflex-reentrant
and also \ref reflex-bison.

#### `-y`, `‚àí‚àíyy`

This option enables `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` to generate a scanner that accepts
Flex lexer specifications and works with Bison parsers, by defining global
(i.e. non-thread-safe and non-reentrant) "yy" variables and functions, such as
`yyin`, `yyout`, `yytext`, `yyleng`, `yylineno`, and `yylex()`.

#### `‚àí‚àíyywrap` and `‚àí‚àínoyywrap`

Option `‚àí‚àíyywrap` generates a scanner that calls the global `int yywrap()`
function when EOF is reached.  This option is only applicable when `‚àí‚àíflex` is
used for compatibility and when `‚àí‚àíflex`  and `‚àí‚àíbison` are used together, or
when `‚àí‚àíyy` is specified.  Wrapping is enabled by default.  Use `‚àí‚àínoyywrap` to
disable the dependence on this global function.  This option has no effect for
C++ lexer classes, which have a virtual `int wrap()` (or `yywrap()` with option
`‚àí‚àíflex`) method that may be overridden.

#### `‚àí‚àíexception=VALUE`

This option defines the exception to be thrown by the generated scanner's
default rule when no rule matches the input.  This option generates a default
rule with action `throw VALUE` and replaces the standard default rule that
echoes all unmatched input text when no rule matches.  This option has no
effect when option `-S` (or `‚àí‚àífind`) is specified.  See also option `-s` (or
`‚àí‚àínodefault`).  Care should be taken to advance the input explicitly in the
exception handler, for example by calling `lexer.matcher().winput()` when
`lexer.size()` is zero.

#### `‚àí‚àítoken-type=NAME`

This option specifies the type of the token values returned by `lex()` and
`yylex()`.  The type of the values returned by `lex()` and `yylex()` is `int`
by default.  This option may be used to specify an alternate token type.
Option `‚àí‚àíbison-complete` automatically defines the appropriate token type
`symbol_type` depending the the parameters specified with options
`‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace` and `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser`.

#### `‚àí‚àítoken-eof=VALUE`

This option specifies the value returned by `lex()` and `yylex()` when the end
of the input is reached and when no `<<EOF>>` rule is present.  By default, a
default-constructed token type value is returned when the end of input is
reached.  For `int` this is `int()`, which is zero.  By setting
`‚àí‚àítoken-type=EOF` the value `EOF` is returned, for example.

### Debugging options                                   {#reflex-options-debug}

#### `-d`, `‚àí‚àídebug`

This enables debug mode in the generated scanner.  Running the scanner produces
debug messages on `std::cerr` standard error and the `debug()` function returns
nonzero.  To temporarily turn off debug messages, use `set_debug(0)` in your
action code.  To turn debug messages back on, use `set_debug(1)`.  The
`set_debug()` and `debug()` methods are virtual methods of the lexer class, so
you can override their behavior in a derived lexer class.  This option also
enables assertions that check for internal errors.  See \ref reflex-debug for
details.

#### `-p`, `‚àí‚àíperf-report`

This enables the collection and reporting of statistics by the generated
scanner.  The scanner reports the performance statistics on `std::cerr` when
EOF is reached.  If your scanner does not reach EOF, then invoke the lexer's
`perf_report()` method explicitly in your code.  Invoking this method also
resets the statistics and timers, meaning that this method will report the
statistics collected since it was last called.  See \ref reflex-debug for
details.

#### `-s`, `‚àí‚àínodefault`

This suppresses the default rule that echoes all unmatched input text when no
rule matches.  With the `‚àí‚àíflex` option, the scanner reports "scanner jammed"
when no rule matches by calling `yyFlexLexer::LexerError("scanner jammed")`.
Without the `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àídebug` options, a `std::runtime` exception is
raised by invoking `AbstractLexer::lexer_error("scanner jammed")`.  To throw a
custom exception instead, use option `‚àí‚àíexception` or override the virtual
method `lexer_error` in a derived lexer class.  The virtual methods
`LexerError` and `lexer_error` may be redefined by a user-specified derived
lexer class, see \ref reflex-inherit.  Without the `‚àí‚àíflex` option, but with
the `‚àí‚àídebug` option, the default rule is suppressed without invoking
`lexer_error` to raise an exception.  See also options `‚àí‚àíexception=VALUE` and
`-S` (or `‚àí‚àífind`).

#### `-v`, `‚àí‚àíverbose`

This displays a summary of scanner statistics.

#### `-w`, `‚àí‚àínowarn`

This disables warnings.

### Miscellaneous options                       {#reflex-options-miscellaneous}

#### `-h`, `‚àí‚àíhelp`

This displays helpful information about <b>`reflex`</b>.

#### `-V`, `‚àí‚àíversion`

This displays the current <b>`reflex`</b> release version.

#### `‚àí‚àíyylineno`, `‚àí‚àíyymore`

These options are enabled by default and have no effect.

Lexer specifications                                             {#reflex-spec}
--------------------

A lexer specification consists of three sections that are divided by
<i>`%%`</i> delimiters that are placed on a single line:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    Definitions
    %%
    Rules
    %%
    User code
~~~
</div>

\ref reflex-spec-defs is used to define named regex patterns, to set options
for the scanner, and for including C++ declarations.

\ref reflex-spec-rules is the main workhorse of the scanner and consists of patterns
and actions, where patterns may use named regex patterns that are defined in
\ref reflex-spec-defs.  The actions are executed when patterns match.  For
example, the following lexer specification replaces all occurrences of `cow` by
`chick` in the input to the scanner:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%
    cow      out() << "chick";
    %%
~~~
</div>

The default rule is to echo any input character that is read from input that
does not match a rule in \ref reflex-spec-rules, so all other text is faithfully
reproduced by this simple scanner example.

Because the pattern `cow` also matches words partly we get `chicks` for `cows`.
But we also get badly garbled output for words such as `coward` and we are
skipping capitalized Cows.  We can improve this with a pattern that anchors
word boundaries and accepts a lower or upper case C:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    cow      \<[Cc]ow\>
    %%
    {cow}    out() << text()[0] << "hick";
    %%
~~~
</div>

Note that we defined a named pattern `cow` in \ref reflex-spec-defs to match
the start and end of a "cow" or capitalized "Cow" with the regex `\<[Cc]ow\>`.
We use `{cow}` in our rule for matching.  The matched text first character is
emitted with `text()[0]` and we simply append a `"hick"` to complete our chick.

Note that regex grouping with parenthesis to capture text matched by a
parenthesized sub-regex is generally not supported by scanner generators, so we
have to use the entire matched `text()` string.

Flex and Lex do not support word boundary anchors `\<`, `\>`, `\b`, and `\B`,
so this example only works with RE/flex.

If you are wondering about the action code in our example not exactly
reflecting the C code expected with Flex, then rest assured that RE/flex
supports the classic Flex and Lex actions such as `yytext` instead of `text()`
and `*yyout` instead of `out()`.  Simply use option `‚àí‚àíflex` to regress to the
C-style Flex names and actions.  Use options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` (or option
`‚àí‚àíyy`) to regress even further to generated a global `yylex()` function and
"yy" variables.

To create a stand-alone scanner, we add `main` to the User code section:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    cow      \<[Cc]ow\>
    %%
    {cow}    out() << text()[0] << "hick";
    %%
    int main() { return Lexer().lex(); }
~~~
</div>

The main function instantiates the lexer class and invokes the scanner, which
will not return until the entire input is processed.  In fact, you can let
<b>`reflex`</b> generate this main function for you with option `‚àí‚àímain`.

More details on these three lexer specification sections is presented next.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### The definitions section                                 {#reflex-spec-defs}

The Definitions section includes name-pattern pairs to define names for
patterns.  Named patterns can be referenced in regex patterns by embracing them
in <i>`{`</i> and <i>`}`</i>.

The following example defines two names for two patterns, where the second
regex pattern uses the previously named pattern:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    digit     [0-9]
    number    {digit}+
~~~
</div>

Patterns ending in an escape `\` continue on the next line with optional line
indentation.  This permits you to organize your layout of long patterns.  See
also \ref reflex-pattern-freespace to improve pattern readability. 

Names must be defined before being referenced.  Names are expanded as macros in
regex patterns.  For example, `{digit}+` is expanded into `[0-9]+`.

@note This is not entirely accurate: when a name is expanded to its right-hand
side pattern `œÜ` then the expanded pattern `œÜ` is placed in a non-capturing
group `(?:œÜ)` to preserve its structure.  For example, `{number}` expands to
`(?:{digit}+)` which in turn expands to `(?:(?:[0-9])+)`.

To inject code into the generated scanner, indent the code or place the code
within a <i>`%{ %}`</i> block.  The <i>`%{`</i> and the matching <i>`%}`</i>
should each be placed at the start of a new line.  To inject code at the very
top of the generated scanner, place this code within a <i>`%%top{ }`</i> block:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include <iostream>    // std::cout etc.
    }
~~~
</div>

\ref reflex-spec-defs may also contain one or more options with
<i>`%%option`</i> (or <i>`%%o`</i> for short).  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option dotall main
    %o matcher=boost
~~~
</div>

Multiple options can be grouped on the same line as is shown above.  See
\ref reflex-options for a list of available options.

@note Options `freespace`, `case-insensitive`, `dotall`, and `unicode` affect
the named patterns defined in \ref reflex-spec-defs.  Therefore, we should
place these options ahead of all named patterns.  If a regex pattern
specifically requires one or more of these options, use the `(?isux:œÜ)`
modifier(s), see \ref reflex-patterns for details.

Consider the following example.  Say we want to count the number of occurrences
of the word "cow" in some text.  We declare a global counter, increment the
counter when we see a "cow", and finally report the total tally when we reach
the end of the input marked by the `<<EOF>>` rule:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option dotall main

    %top{
      #include <iostream>    // std::cout etc.
    }

    %{
      static int herd = 0;   // a global static variable to count cows
    %}

    cow        \<[Cc]ow\>

    %%

    {cow}      herd++;       // found a cow, bump count by one
    .          // do nothing
    <<EOF>>    out() << herd << " cows!" << std::endl; return 0;

    %%
~~~
</div>

The above works fine, but we are using a global counter which is not a best
practice and is not thread-safe: multiple Lexer class instances may compete to
bump the counter.  Another problem is that the Lexer can only be used once,
there is no proper initialization to restart the Lexer on new input.

RE/flex allows you to inject code in the generated Lexer class, meaning that
class members and constructor code can be added to manage the Lexer class
state.  All Lexer class members are visible in actions, even when private.  New
Lexers can be instantiated given some input to scan.  Lexers can run in
parallel in threads without requiring synchronization when their state is part
of the instance and not managed by global variables.

To inject Lexer class member declarations such as variables and methods, place
the declarations within <i>`%%class{ }`</i> block.  The <i>`%%class{`</i> and
the matching <i>`}`</i> should each be placed at the start of a new line.

Likewise, to inject Lexer class constructor code, for example to initialize
members, place the code within <i>`%%init{ }`</i> block.  The <i>`%%init{`</i>
and the matching <i>`}`</i> should each be placed at the start of a new line.
Option <i>`%%option ctorarg="argument, argument, ..."`</i> may be used to
declare the constructor arguments of the Lexer class constructor.  Option
<i>`%%option ctorinit="initializer, initializer, ..."`</i> specifies constructor
initializers.  See also \ref reflex-lexer.

Additional constructors and/or a destructor may be placed in a 
<i>`%%class{ }`</i> block, for class `Lexer` (or `yyFlexLexer` with option
`‚àí‚àíflex`), unless the class is renamed with option `‚àí‚àílexer=NAME`
(<i>`%%option lexer=NAME`</i>).

For convenience you can use the generated `REFLEX_OPTION_lexer` macro in your
code that expands to the class name.  To do so, use <b>`reflex`</b> option
`‚àí‚àíheader-file` to generate a header file to include in your code.

For example, we use these code injectors to make our cow counter `herd` part of
the Lexer class state.  We also add a sound "Moo!" when a cow was matched, to
illustrate the use of a static data member that is initialized ouf of line:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option dotall main

    %top{
      #include <iostream>  // std::cout etc.
    }

    %class{
      int herd;  // lexer class member variable (private by default)
      static const char *moo;  // a static data member
    }

    %init{
      herd = 0;  // initialize member variable in Lexer class constructor
    }

    %{
      const char *Lexer::moo = "Moo!";  // must be initialized out of line
    %}

    cow        \<[Cc]ow\>

    %%

    {cow}      herd++;       // found a cow, bump count by one
               out() << moo << " ";
    .          // do nothing
    <<EOF>>    out() << herd << " cows!" << std::endl; return 0;

    %%
~~~
</div>

Note that nothing else needs to be changed, because the actions are part of
the generated Lexer class and can access the Lexer class members, which in this
example is the member variable `herd`.

In this example, we just search for pattern matches and ignore everything else
with a dot rule with no action.  This dot matches newlines too because we
specified option `dotall`.  Searching for pattern matches like this example can
be done much more efficiently with option `find` to generate a search engine
instead of a scanner:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option find main
~~~
</div>

We should not forget to remove the dot rule from our lexer specification, otherwise
we still match a lot that we don't need to match:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    .          // do nothing REMOVE THIS LINE!
~~~
</div>

To modularize specifications of lexers, use <i>`%%include`</i> (or <i>`%%i`</i>
for short) to include one or more files into \ref reflex-spec-defs of a
specification.  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %include "examples/jdefs.l"
~~~
</div>

This includes <i>`examples/jdefs.l`</i> with Java patterns into the current
specification so you can match Java lexical structures, such as copying Java
identifiers to the output given some Java source program as input:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %include "examples/jdefs.l"
    %%
    {Identifier}    echo();
    .|\n            // do nothing
    %%
~~~
</div>

Multiple files may be specified with one <i>`%%include`</i>.  Quotes may be
omitted from the <i>`%%include`</i> argument if the argument has no punctuation
characters except `.` and `-`, for example <i>`%%include jdefs.l`</i>.

To declare start condition state names use <i>`%%state`</i> (or <i>`%%s`</i>
for short) to declare inclusive states and use <i>`%%xstate`</i> (or
<i>`%%x`</i> for short) to declare exclusive states:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %s INCLUSIVE
    %x EXCLUSIVE
~~~
</div>

See \ref reflex-states for more information about states.

### The rules section                                      {#reflex-spec-rules}

Each rule in the rules section consists of a pattern-action pair separated by
spacing after the pattern (unless free space mode is enabled).  For example, the
following defines an action for a pattern:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    [0-9]+      out() << "number " << text() << std::endl;
~~~
</div>

To add action code that spans multiple lines, indent the code or place the code
in a <i>`{ }`</i> block.  When local variables are declared in an action then
the code should always be placed in a block.

In free space mode you MUST place actions in <i>`{ }`</i> blocks and user code
in <i>`%{ %}`</i> blocks instead of indented, see
\ref reflex-pattern-freespace.

Actions in the rules section can use predefined RE/flex variables and
functions.  With <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíflex`, the variables and functions
are the classic Flex actions shown in the second column of this table:

  RE/flex action           | Flex action          | Result
  ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------
  `text()`                 | `YYText()`, `yytext` | 0-terminated text match

  `border()`               | *n/a*                | border of the match (>=0)
  `echo()`                 | `ECHO`               | `out().write(text(), size())`
  `in(i)`                  | `yyrestart(i)`       | set input to `reflex::Input i`
  `in()`, `in() = i`       | `*yyin`, `yyin = &i` | get/set `reflex::Input i`
  `out(o)`                 | `yyout = &o`         | set output to `std::ostream o`

A `reflex::Input` input source is denoted `i` in the table, which can be
`FILE*` descriptor, `std::istream`, a string `std::string` or `const char*`, or
a wide string `std::wstring` or `const wchar_t*`.  Output `o` is a
`std::ostream` object.

Note that Flex `switch_streams(i, o)` is the same as invoking the `in(i)` and
`out(o)` methods.  Flex `yyrestart(i)` is the same as invoking `in(i)` to set
input to a file, stream, or string.  Invoking `switch_streams(i, o)` and
`in(i)` also resets the lexer's matcher (internally with `matcher.reset()`).
This clears the line and column counters, resets the internal anchor and
boundary flags for anchor and word boundary matching, and resets the matcher to
consume buffered input.

You can also set the input with `in() = i` (or `yyin = &i)` with option
`‚àí‚àíflex`).  This however does not reset the matcher.  This means that when an
end of input (EOF) was reached, you should clear the EOF state first with
`matcher().set_end(false)` or reset the matcher state with `matcher().reset()`.
Resetting the matcher state also flushes the remaining input from the buffer,
which would otherwise still be consumed.  Using `in(i)` (or `yyrestart(i)` with
option `‚àí‚àíflex`) is therefore preferable.

The `matcher().input()`, `matcher().winput()`, and `matcher().peek()` methods
return a non-negative character code and EOF (-1) when the end of input is
reached.  These methods preserve the current `text()` match (and `yytext` with
option `‚àí‚àíflex`), but the pointer returned by `text()` (and `yytext`) may
change after these methods are called.  However, the `yytext` pointer is not
preserved when using these methods with <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àíflex` and
`‚àí‚àíbison`.

@warning The Flex-compatible `yyinput()` function returns 0 when the end of
input is reached, which makes it impossible to distinguish `\0` (NUL) from EOF.
By contrast, `matcher().input()` returns EOF (-1) when the end of the input is
reached.

@warning Do not invoke `matcher()` before the `lex()` (or `yylex()` with option
`‚àí‚àíflex`) is invoked!  A matcher is not initially assigned to a lexer when the
lexer is constructed, leaving `matcher()` undefined.

The `matcher().skip(c)` method skips input until `char` or wide `wchar_t`
character `c` is consumed and returns `true` when found.  This method changes
`text()` (and `yytext` with option `‚àí‚àíflex`).  This method is more efficient
than repeatedly calling `matcher().input()`.  Likewise, `matcher().skip(s)`
skips input until UTF-8 string `s` is consumed and returns `true` when found.

Use <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` (or option `‚àí‚àíyy`) to enable
global Flex actions and variables.  This makes Flex actions and variables
globally accessible outside of \ref reflex-spec-rules, with the exception of
`yy_push_state()`, `yy_pop_state()`, `yy_top_state()`.  Outside
\ref reflex-spec-rules you must use the global action `yyinput()` instead of
`input()`, global action `yyunput()` instead of `unput()`, and global action
`yyoutput()` instead of `output()`.  Because `yyin` and `yyout` are macros they
cannot be (re)declared or accessed as global variables, but they can be used as
if these were variables.  To avoid compilation errors, use <b>`reflex`</b>
option `‚àí‚àíheader-file` to generate a header file <i>`lex.yy.h`</i> to include
in your code to use the global use Flex actions and variables.  See
\ref reflex-bison for more details on the `‚àí‚àíbison` options to use.

When using <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àíflex`, `‚àí‚àíbison` and `‚àí‚àíreentrant`, most
Flex functions take a `yyscan_t` scanner as an extra last argument.  See
\ref reflex-reentrant for details.

From the first couple of entries in the table shown above you may have guessed
correctly that `text()` is just a shorthand for `matcher().text()`, since
`matcher()` is the matcher object associated with the generated Lexer class.
The same shorthand apply to `str()`, `wstr()`, `size()`, `wsize()`,
`lineno()`, `columno()`, and `border()`.  Use `text()` for fast access to the
matched text.  The `str()` method returns a string copy of the match and is
less efficient.  Likewise, `wstr()` returns a wide string copy of the match,
converted from UTF-8.

The `lineno()` method returns the line number of the match, starting at line 1.
The ending line number is `lineno_end()`, which is identical to the value of
`lineno()` + `lines()` - 1.  

The `columno()` method returns the column offset of a match from the start of
the line, beginning at column 0.  This method takes tab spacing and wide
characters into account.  The inclusive ending column number is given by
`columno_end()`, which is equal or larger than `columno()` if the match does
not span multiple lines.  Otherwise, if the match spans multiple lines,
`columno_end()` is the ending column of the match on the last matching line.

The `lines()` and `columns()` methods return the number of lines and columns
matched, where `columns()` takes tab spacing and wide characters into account.
If the match spans multiple lines, `columns()` counts columns over all lines,
without counting the newline characters.

The starting byte offset of the match on a line is `border()` and the inclusive
ending byte offset of the match is `border() + size() - 1`.

@note A wide character is counted as one, thus `columno()`, `columno_end()`,
and `columns()` do not take the character width of full-width and combining
Unicode characters into account.  It is recommended to use the `wcwidth`
function or
[wcwidth.c](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c) to determine Unicode
character widths.

The `matcher().more()` method is used to create longer matches by stringing
together consecutive matches in the input after scanning the input with the
`scan()` method.  When this method is invoked, the next match with `scan()` has
its matched text prepended to it.  The `matcher().more()` operation is often
used in lexers and was introduced in Lex.

The `matcher().less(n)` method reduces the size of the matched text to `n`
bytes.  This method has no effect if `n` is larger than `size()`.  The value of
`n` should not be `0` to prevent infinite looping on the same input as no input
is consumed (or you could switch to another start condition state with
`start(n)` in the action that uses `less(0)`).  The `matcher().less(n)`
operation was introduced in Lex and is often used in lexers to place input back
into the input stream and as a means to perform sophisticated lookaheads.

The `matcher().first()` and `matcher().last()` methods return the position in
the input stream of the match, counting in bytes from the start of the input at
position 0.  If the input stream is a wide character sequence, the UTF-8
positions are returned as a result of the internally-converted UTF-8 wide
character input.

The `matcher().rest()` method returns the rest of the input character sequence
as a 0-terminated `char*` string.  This method buffers all remaining input to
return the string.

The `matcher().span()` method enlarges the text matched to span the entire line
and returns the matching line as a 0-terminated `char*` string without the `\n`.

The `matcher().line()` and `matcher().wline()` methods return the entire line
as a (wide) string with the matched text as a substring.  These methods can be
used to obtain the context of a match, for example to display the line where a
lexical error or syntax error occurred.

@warning The methods `matcher().span()`, `matcher().line()`, and
`matcher().wline()` invalidate the previous `text()`, `yytext`, `strview()`,
`begin()`, `bol()`, and `end()` string pointers.  Call these methods again to
retrieve the updated pointer or call `str()` or `wstr()` to obtain a string
copy of the match:
~~~{.cpp}
    // INCORRECT, because t is invalid after line():
    const char *t = matcher().text();
    std::string s = matcher().line();
    std::cout << t << " in " << s << std::endl;
    // OK with line():
    std::string s = matcher().line();
    const char *t = matcher().text();
    std::cout << t << " in " << s << std::endl;
    // OK with span():
    std::string t = matcher().str();
    const char *s = matcher().span();
    std::cout << t << " in " << s << std::endl;
~~~
The start of a line is truncated when the line is too long, longer than 256K
which is the initial buffer size `reflex::AbstractMatcher::Const::BUFSZ`.  When
this length is exceeded, the line's length before the match is truncated.  This
ensures that pattern matching binary files or files with very long lines cannot
cause memory allocation exceptions.

Because `matcher()` returns the current matcher object, the following Flex-like
actions are also supported:

  RE/flex action            | Flex action             | Result
  ------------------------- | ----------------------- | -----------------------
  `matcher().buffer()`      | *n/a*                   | buffer entire input
  `matcher().buffer(n)`     | *n/a*                   | set buffer size to `n`
  `matcher().interactive()` | `yy_set_interactive(1)` | set interactive input
  `matcher().flush()`       | `YY_FLUSH_BUFFER`       | flush input buffer
  `matcher().set_bol(b)`    | `yy_set_bol(b)`         | (re)set begin of line
  `matcher().set_bob(b)`    | *n/a*                   | (re)set begin of input
  `matcher().set_end(b)`    | *n/a*                   | (re)set end of input
  `matcher().reset()   `    | *n/a*                   | reset the state as new

You can switch to a new matcher while scanning input, and use operations to
create a new matcher, push/pop a matcher on/from a stack, and delete a matcher:

  RE/flex action    | Flex action              | Result
  ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------
  `matcher(m)`      | `yy_switch_to_buffer(m)` | use matcher `m`
  `new_matcher(i)`  | `yy_create_buffer(i, n)` | returns new matcher for `reflex::Input i`
  `del_matcher(m)`  | `yy_delete_buffer(m)`    | delete matcher `m`
  `push_matcher(m)` | `yypush_buffer_state(m)` | push current matcher, then use `m`
  `pop_matcher()`   | `yypop_buffer_state()`   | pop matcher and delete current
  `ptr_matcher()`   | `YY_CURRENT_BUFFER`      | pointer to current matcher
  `has_matcher()`   | `YY_CURRENT_BUFFER != 0` | current matcher is usable

The matcher type `m` is a Lexer class-specific `Matcher` type, which depends on
the underlying matcher used by the scanner.  Therefore, `new_matcher(i)`
instantiates a `reflex::Matcher` or the matcher specified with the `‚àí‚àímatcher`
option.

The `push_matcher()` and `pop_matcher()` functions can be used to temporarily
switch to another input source while preserving the original input source
associated with the matcher on the stack with `push_matcher()`.  The
`pop_matcher()` action returns `true` when successful and `false` otherwise,
when the stack is empty.  When `false`, `has_matcher()` returns `false` and
`ptr_matcher()` returns `NULL`.  See also \ref reflex-multiple-input.

The following Flex actions are also supported with <b>`reflex`</b> option
`‚àí‚àíflex`:

  RE/flex action   | Flex action              | Result
  ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------
  `in(s)`          | `yy_scan_string(s)`      | reset and scan string `s` (`std::string` or `char*`)
  `in(s)`          | `yy_scan_wstring(s)`     | reset and scan wide string `s` (`std::wstring` or `wchar_t*`)
  `in(b, n)`       | `yy_scan_bytes(b, n)`    | reset and scan `n` bytes at address `b` (buffered)
  `buffer(b, n+1)` | `yy_scan_buffer(b, n+2)` | reset and scan `n` bytes at address `b` (zero copy)

These functions create a new buffer (i.e. a new matcher in RE/flex) to
incrementally buffer the input on demand, except for `yy_scan_buffer` that
scans a string in place (i.e. zero copy) that should end with two zero bytes,
which are included in the specified length.  A pointer to the new buffer is
returned, which becomes the `YY_CURRENT_BUFFER`.  You should delete the old
buffer with `yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER)` before creating a new buffer
with one of these functions.  See \ref reflex-input for more details.

The generated scanner reads from the standard input by default or from an input
source specified as a `reflex::Input` object, such as a string, wide string,
file, or a stream.  See \ref reflex-input for more details on managing the
input to a scanner.

These functions take an extra last `yyscan_t` argument for reentrant scanners
generated with option `‚àí‚àíreentrant`.  This argument is a pointer to a lexer
object.  See \ref reflex-reentrant for more details.

### User code sections                                      {#reflex-spec-user}

To inject code at the end of the generated scanner, such as a `main`
function, we can use the third and final User code section.  All of the code in
the User code section is copied to the generated scanner.

Below is a User code section example with `main` that invokes the lexer to read
from standard input (the default input) and display all numbers found:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include <iostream>
    }

    digit       [0-9]
    number      {digit}+

    %%

    {number}    out() << "number " << text() << std::endl;

    %%

    int main() { return Lexer().lex(); }
~~~
</div>

You can also automatically generate a `main` with the <b>`reflex`</b> `‚àí‚àímain`
option, which will produce the same `main` function shown in the example above.
This creates a stand-alone scanner that instantiates a Lexer that reads input
from standard input.

To scan from other input than standard input, such as from files, streams, and
strings, instantiate the Lexer class with the input source as the first
argument.  To set an alternative output stream than standard output, pass a
`std::ostream` object as the second argument to the Lexer class constructor:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
      FILE *fd = stdin;
      if (argc > 1 && (fd = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL)
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      std::ofstream of("output.txt", std::ofstream::out);
      if (!of)
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      Lexer(fd, of).lex();
      of.close();
      if (fd != stdin)
        fclose(fd);
      return 0;
    }
~~~
</div>

The above uses a `FILE` descriptor to read input from, which has the advantage
of automatically decoding UTF-8/16/32 input.  Other permissible input sources
are `std::istream`, `std::string`, `std::wstring`, `char*`, and `wchar_t*`.

Patterns                                                     {#reflex-patterns}
--------

The regex pattern syntax you can use generally depends on the regex matcher
library that you use.  Fortunately, RE/flex accept a broad pattern syntax for
lexer specifications.  The <b>`reflex`</b> command internally converts the
regex patterns to regex forms that the underlying matcher engine library can
handle (except when specifically indicated in the tables that follow).  This
ensures that the same pattern syntax can be used with any matcher engine
library that RE/flex currently supports.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Pattern syntax                                     {#reflex-pattern-syntax}

A pattern is an extended set of regular expressions, with nested sub-expression
patterns `œÜ` and `œà`:

  Pattern   | Matches
  --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
  `x`       | matches the character `x`, where `x` is not a special character
  `.`       | matches any single character or a byte, except newline (unless in dotall mode)
  `\.`      | matches `.` (dot), special characters are escaped with a backslash
  `\n`      | matches a newline, others are `\a` (BEL), `\b` (BS), `\t` (HT), `\v` (VT), `\f` (FF), and `\r` (CR)
  `\N`      | matches any single character except newline
  `\0`      | matches the NUL character
  `\cX`     | matches the control character `X` mod 32 (e.g. `\cA` is `\x01`)
  `\0141`   | matches an 8-bit character with octal value `141` (use `\141` in lexer specifications instead, see below)
  `\x7f`    | matches an 8-bit character with hexadecimal value `7f`
  `\x{3B1}` | matches Unicode character U+03B1, i.e. `Œ±`
  `\u{3B1}` | matches Unicode character U+03B1, i.e. `Œ±`
  `\o{141}` | matches U+0061, i.e. `a`, in octal
  `\p{C}`   | matches a character in category C of \ref reflex-pattern-cat
  `\Q...\E` | matches the quoted content between `\Q` and `\E` literally
  `[abc]`   | matches one of `a`, `b`, or `c` as \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[0-9]`   | matches a digit `0` to `9` as \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[^0-9]`  | matches any character except a digit as \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `œÜ?`      | matches `œÜ` zero or one time (optional)
  `œÜ*`      | matches `œÜ` zero or more times (repetition)
  `œÜ+`      | matches `œÜ` one or more times (repetition)
  `œÜ{2,5}`  | matches `œÜ` two to five times (repetition)
  `œÜ{2,}`   | matches `œÜ` at least two times (repetition)
  `œÜ{2}`    | matches `œÜ` exactly two times (repetition)
  `œÜ??`     | matches `œÜ` zero or once as needed (lazy optional)
  `œÜ*?`     | matches `œÜ` a minimum number of times as needed (lazy repetition)
  `œÜ+?`     | matches `œÜ` a minimum number of times at least once as needed (lazy repetition)
  `œÜ{2,5}?` | matches `œÜ` two to five times as needed (lazy repetition)
  `œÜ{2,}?`  | matches `œÜ` at least two times or more as needed (lazy repetition)
  `œÜœà`      | matches `œÜ` then matches `œà` (concatenation)
  `œÜ‚éÆœà`     | matches `œÜ` or matches `œà` (alternation)
  `(œÜ)`     | matches `œÜ` as a group to capture (this is non-capturing in lexer specifications)
  `(?:œÜ)`   | matches `œÜ` without group capture
  `(?=œÜ)`   | matches `œÜ` without consuming it (\ref reflex-pattern-lookahead)
  `(?<=œÜ)`  | matches `œÜ` to the left without consuming it (\ref reflex-pattern-lookbehind, not supported by the RE/flex matcher)
  `(?^œÜ)`   | matches `œÜ` and ignores it, marking everything as a non-match to continue matching (RE/flex matcher only)
  `^œÜ`      | matches `œÜ` at the begin of input or begin of a line (requires multi-line mode) (top-level `œÜ` only, not nested in a sub-pattern)
  `œÜ$`      | matches `œÜ` at the end of input or end of a line (requires multi-line mode) (top-level `œÜ` only, not nested in a sub-pattern)
  `\AœÜ`     | matches `œÜ` at the begin of input (top-level `œÜ`, not nested in a sub-pattern)
  `œÜ\z`     | matches `œÜ` at the end of input (top-level `œÜ`, not nested in a sub-pattern)
  `\bœÜ`     | matches `œÜ` starting at a word boundary
  `œÜ\b`     | matches `œÜ` ending at a word boundary
  `\BœÜ`     | matches `œÜ` starting at a non-word boundary
  `œÜ\B`     | matches `œÜ` ending at a non-word boundary
  `\<œÜ`     | matches `œÜ` that starts a word
  `\>œÜ`     | matches `œÜ` that starts a non-word
  `œÜ\<`     | matches `œÜ` that ends a non-word
  `œÜ\>`     | matches `œÜ` that ends a word
  `\i`      | matches an indent for \ref reflex-pattern-dents matching
  `\j`      | matches a dedent for \ref reflex-pattern-dents matching
  `\k`      | matches if indent depth changed, undoing this change to keep the current indent stops for \ref reflex-pattern-dents matching
  `(?i:œÜ)`  | \ref reflex-pattern-anycase matches `œÜ` ignoring case
  `(?m:œÜ)`  | \ref reflex-pattern-multiline `^` and `$` in `œÜ` match begin and end of a line (default in lexer specifications)
  `(?s:œÜ)`  | \ref reflex-pattern-dotall `.` (dot) in `œÜ` matches newline
  `(?u:œÜ)`  | \ref reflex-pattern-unicode `.`, `\s`, `\w`, `\l`, `\u`, `\S`, `\W`, `\L`, `\U` match Unicode
  `(?x:œÜ)`  | \ref reflex-pattern-freespace ignore all whitespace and comments in `œÜ`
  `(?#:X)`  | all of `X` is skipped as a comment

Word boundaries `\<`, `\>`, `\b` and `\B` demarcate words.  Word characters are
letters, digits, and the underscore.  Anchors `\A` and `\z` demarcate the begin
and end of the input, respectively.  Anchors `^` and `$` demarcate the begin
and end of a line, respectively, because multi-line mode is enabled by default
in all RE/flex-generated scanners.  See also \ref reflex-pattern-anchor.

Indentation matching with `\i`, `\j` and `\k` is a RE/flex feature available
only with the RE/flex regex library that supports it.  See also \ref
reflex-pattern-dents for more details.

@note The lazy quantifier `?` for optional patterns `œÜ??` and repetitions `œÜ*?`
`œÜ+?` is not supported by Boost.Regex in POSIX mode.  In general, POSIX
matchers do not support lazy quantifiers due to POSIX limitations that are
rooted in the theory of formal languages FSM of regular expressions.  The
RE/flex regex library is regex POSIX compliant and supports lazy quantifiers as
an addition.

@warning Option `‚àí‚àífast` does not produce code that backtracks, which means
that patterns such as `bar.*\bfoo` that require backtracking on `\b` may not
work properly.  If necessary, use option `‚àí‚àífull` when word boundaries are used
when these require backtracking to find a match.

The following patterns are available in RE/flex and adopt the same Flex/Lex
patterns syntax.  These pattern should only be used in lexer specifications:

  Pattern            | Matches
  ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------
  `\177`             | matches an 8-bit character with octal value `177`
  `"..."`            | matches the quoted content literally
  `œÜ/œà`              | matches `œÜ` if followed by `œà` as a \ref reflex-pattern-trailing
  `<S>œÜ`             | matches `œÜ` only if state `S` is enabled in \ref reflex-states
  `<S1,S2,S3>œÜ`      | matches `œÜ` only if state `S1`, `S2`, or state `S3` is enabled in \ref reflex-states
  `<*>œÜ`             | matches `œÜ` in any state of the \ref reflex-states
  `<<EOF>>`          | matches EOF in any state of the \ref reflex-states
  `<S><<EOF>>`       | matches EOF only if state `S` is enabled in \ref reflex-states
  `[a-zÔø®Ôø®[A-Z]]`     | matches a letter, see \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[a-z&&[^aeiou]]`  | matches a consonant, see \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[a-z‚àí‚àí[aeiou]]`   | matches a consonant, see \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[a-z]{+}[A-Z]`    | matches a letter, same as `[a-zÔø®Ôø®[A-Z]]`, see \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[a-z]{Ôø®}[A-Z]`    | matches a letter, same as `[a-zÔø®Ôø®[A-Z]]`, see \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[a-z]{&}[^aeiou]` | matches a consonant, same as `[a-z&&[^aeiou]]`, see \ref reflex-pattern-class
  `[a-z]{-}[aeiou]`  | matches a consonant, same as `[a-z‚àí‚àí[aeiou]]`, see \ref reflex-pattern-class

Note that the characters `.` (dot), `\`, `?`, `*`, `+`, `|`, `(`, `)`, `[`,
`]`, `{`, `}`, `^`, and `$` are meta-characters and should be escaped to match.
Lexer specifications also include the `"` and `/` as meta-characters and these
should be escaped to match.

Spaces and tabs cannot be matched in patterns in lexer specifications.  To
match the space character use `" "` or `[ ]` and to match the tab character use
`\t`.  Use `\h` to match a space or tab.

The order of precedence for composing larger patterns from sub-patterns is as
follows, from high to low precedence:

1. Characters, character classes (bracket expressions), escapes, quotation
2. Grouping `(œÜ)`, `(?:œÜ)`, `(?=œÜ)`, and inline modifiers `(?imsux-imsux:œÜ)`
3. Quantifiers `?`, `*`, `+`, `{n,m}`
4. Concatenation `œÜœà` (including trailing context `œÜ/œà`)
5. Anchoring `^`, `$`, `\<`, `\>`, `\b`, `\B`, `\A`, `\z` 
6. Alternation `œÜ|œà`
7. Global modifiers `(?imsux-imsux)œÜ`

@note When using regex patterns in C++ literal strings, make sure that "regex
escapes are escaped", meaning that an extra backslash is needed for every
backslash in the regex string.

@note Trigraphs in C/C++ strings are special tripple-character sequences,
beginning with two question marks and followed by a character that is
translated.  Avoid `??` in regex strings.  Instead, use at least one escaped
question mark, such as `?\?`, which the compiler will translate to `??`.  This
problem does not apply to lexer specifications that the <b>`reflex`</b> command
converts to regex strings.  Fortunately, most C++ compilers ignore trigraphs
unless in standard-conforming modes, such as `-ansi` and `-std=c++98`.

### Character classes                                   {#reflex-pattern-class}

Character classes in bracket lists represent sets of characters.  Sets can be
negated (or inverted), subtracted, intersected, and merged (except for the
`PCRE2Matcher`):

  Pattern           | Matches
  ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
  `[a-zA-Z]`        | matches a letter
  `[^a-zA-Z]`       | matches a non-letter (character class negation)
  `[a-zÔø®Ôø®[A-Z]]`    | matches a letter (character class union)
  `[a-z&&[^aeiou]]` | matches a consonant (character class intersection)
  `[a-z‚àí‚àí[aeiou]]`  | matches a consonant (character class subtraction)

Bracket lists cannot be empty, so `[]` and `[^]` are invalid.  In fact, the
first character after the bracket is always part of the list.  So `[][]` is a
list that matches a `]` and a `[`, `[^][]` is a list that matches anything but
`]` and `[`, and `[-^]` is a list that matches a `-` and a `^`.

It is an error to construct an empty character class by subtraction or by
intersection, for example `[a&&[b]]` is invalid.

Bracket lists may contain ASCII and Unicode \ref reflex-pattern-cat, for
example `[a-z\d]` contains the letters `a` to `z` and digits `0` to `9` (or
Unicode digits when Unicode is enabled).  To add Unicode character categories
and wide characters (encoded in UTF-8) to bracket lists
\ref reflex-pattern-unicode should be enabled.

An negated Unicode character class is constructed by subtracting the character
class from the Unicode range U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF.

Character class operations can be chained together in a bracket list.  The
union `||`, intersection `&&`, and subtraction `--` operations are left
associative and have the same operator precedence.  For example,
`[a-z||[A-Z]--[aeiou]--[AEIOU]]`, `[a-z--[aeiou]||[A-Z]--[AEIUO]]`,
`[a-z&&[^aeiou]||[A-Z]&&[^AEIOU]]`, and `[B-DF-HJ-NP-TV-Zb-df-hj-np-tv-z]` are
the same character classes.

Character class operations may be nested.  For example, `[a-z||[A-Z||[0-9]]]`
is the same as `[a-zA-Z0-9]`.

Character class negation, when specified, is applied to the resulting character
class after the character class operations are applied.  For example,
`[^a-z||[A-Z]]` is the same as `[^||[a-z]||[A-Z]]`, which is the class
`[^a-zA-Z]`.

Note that negated character classes such as `[^a-zA-Z]` match newlines when
`\n` is not included in the class.  Include `\n` in the negated character class
to prevent matching newlines.  The `reflex::convert_flag::notnewline` removes
newlines from character classes when used with \ref regex-convert, except for
patterns `\P{C}`, `\R`, `\D`, `\H`, and `\W`.

A lexer specification may use a defined name in place of the second operand of
a character class operation.  A defined name when used as an operand should
expand into a POSIX character class containing ASCII characters only.  For
example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    lower     [a-z]
    upper     [A-Z]
    letter    [||{lower}||{upper}]
    alnum     [0-9||{letter}]
    name      {letter}{alnum}*
    %%
    {name}    std::cout << "name: " << text() << std::endl;
    .|\n      // skip everything else
    %%
~~~
</div>

@warning Defined names may only occur immediately after a `||`, `&&`, and a
`--` operator in a bracket list.  Do not place a defined name as the first
operand to a union, intersection, and subtraction operation, because the
definition is not expanded.  For example, `[{lower}||{upper}]` contains
`[A-Zelorw{}]`.  The name and the `{`, `}` characters are literally included in
the resulting character class.  Instead, this bracket list should be written as
`[||{lower}||{upper}]`.  Likewise, `[^{lower}||{upper}]` should be written as
`[^||{lower}||{upper}]`.

Alternatively, unions may be written as alternations.  That is,
`[||{name1}||{name2}||{name3}||...]` can be written as
`({name1}|{name2}|{name3}|...)`, where the latter form supports full Unicode
not restricted to ASCII.

The character class operators `{+}` (or `{|}`), `{&}`, and `{-}` may be used in
lexer specifications.  Note that Flex only supports the two operators `{+}` and
`{-}`:

  Pattern            | Matches
  ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------
  `[a-z]{+}[A-Z]`    | matches a letter, same as `[a-zÔø®Ôø®[A-Z]]`
  `[a-z]{Ôø®}[A-Z]`    | matches a letter, same as `[a-zÔø®Ôø®[A-Z]]`
  `[a-z]{&}[^aeiou]` | matches a consonant, same as `[a-z&&[^aeiou]]`
  `[a-z]{-}[aeiou]`  | matches a consonant, same as `[a-z‚àí‚àí[aeiou]]`

Multiple operators can be chained together.  Unlike Flex, defined names may be
used as operands.  For example `{lower}{+}{upper}` is the same as
`[a-z]{+}[A-Z]`, i.e. the character class `[A-Za-z]`.  A defined name when used
as an operand should expand into a POSIX character class containing ASCII
characters only.

### Character categories                                  {#reflex-pattern-cat}

The 7-bit ASCII POSIX character categories are:

  POSIX form   | Matches
  ------------ | ---------------------------------------------
  `[:ascii:]`  | matches any ASCII character
  `[:space:]`  | matches a white space character `[ \t\n\v\f\r]`
  `[:xdigit:]` | matches a hex digit `[0-9A-Fa-f]`
  `[:cntrl:]`  | matches a control character `[\x00-\x1f\x7f]`
  `[:print:]`  | matches a printable character `[\x20-\x7e]`
  `[:alnum:]`  | matches a alphanumeric character `[0-9A-Za-z]`
  `[:alpha:]`  | matches a letter `[A-Za-z]`
  `[:blank:]`  | matches a blank character `\h` same as `[ \t]`
  `[:digit:]`  | matches a digit `[0-9]`
  `[:graph:]`  | matches a visible character `[\x21-\x7e]`
  `[:lower:]`  | matches a lower case letter `[a-z]`
  `[:punct:]`  | matches a punctuation character `[\x21-\x2f\x3a-\x40\x5b-\x60\x7b-\x7e]`
  `[:upper:]`  | matches an upper case letter `[A-Z]`
  `[:word:]`   | matches a word character `[0-9A-Za-z_]`
  `[:^blank:]` | matches a non-blank character `\H` same as `[^ \t]`
  `[:^digit:]` | matches a non-digit `[^0-9]`

The POSIX forms are used in bracket lists.  For example `[[:lower:][:digit:]]`
matches an ASCII lower case letter or a digit.  

You can also use the upper case `\P{C}` form that has the same meaning as
`\p{^C}`, which matches any character except characters in the class `C`.
For example, `\P{ASCII}` is the same as `\p{^ASCII}` which is the same as
`[^[:ascii:]]`.

When Unicode matching mode is enabled, `[^[:ascii]]` is a Unicode character
class that excludes the ASCII character category.  Unicode character classes
and categories require the <b>`reflex`</b> `‚àí‚àíunicode` option.

The following Unicode character categories are enabled with the <b>`reflex`</b>
`‚àí‚àíunicode` option or \ref reflex-pattern-unicode `(?u:œÜ)` and with the regex
matcher converter flag `reflex::convert_flag::unicode` when using a regex
library:

@note Unicode language script character classes differ from the Unicode blocks
that have a similar name.  For example, the `\p{Greek}` class represents Greek
and Coptic letters and differs from the Unicode block `\p{IsGreek}` that spans
a specific Unicode block of Greek and Coptic characters only, which also
includes unassigned characters.

### Anchors and boundaries                             {#reflex-pattern-anchor}

Anchors are used to demarcate the start and end of input or the start and end
of a line:

  Pattern   | Matches
  --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
  `^œÜ`      | matches `œÜ` at the start of input or start of a line (multi-line mode)
  `œÜ$`      | matches `œÜ` at the end of input or end of a line (multi-line mode)
  `\AœÜ`     | matches `œÜ` at the start of input
  `œÜ\z`     | matches `œÜ` at the end of input

Anchors in lexer specifications require pattern context, meaning that `œÜ`
cannot be empty.

Note that `<<EOF>>` in lexer specifications match the end of input, which 
can be used in place of the pattern `\z`.

Actions for the start of input can be specified in an initial code block
preceding the rules, see \ref reflex-code-blocks.

Word boundaries demarcate words.  Word characters are letters, digits, and the
underscore.

  Pattern   | Matches
  --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
  `\bœÜ`     | matches `œÜ` starting at a word boundary
  `œÜ\b`     | matches `œÜ` ending at a word boundary
  `\BœÜ`     | matches `œÜ` starting at a non-word boundary
  `œÜ\B`     | matches `œÜ` ending at a non-word boundary
  `\<œÜ`     | matches `œÜ` that starts as a word
  `\>œÜ`     | matches `œÜ` that starts as a non-word
  `œÜ\<`     | matches `œÜ` that ends as a non-word
  `œÜ\>`     | matches `œÜ` that ends as a word

### Indent/nodent/dedent                                {#reflex-pattern-dents}

Automatic indent and dedent matching is a special feature of RE/flex and is
only available when the RE/flex matcher engine is used (the default matcher).
An indent and a dedent position is defined and matched with:

  Pattern | Matches
  ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------
  `\i`    | indent: matches and adds a new indent stop position
  `\j`    | dedent: matches a previous indent position, removes one indent stop

The `\i` and `\j` anchors should be used in combination with the start of a
line anchor `^` followed by a pattern that represents left margin spacing for
indentations, followed by a `\i` or a `\j` at the end of the pattern.  The
margin spacing pattern may include any characters that are considered part of
the left margin, but should exclude `\n`.  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %o tabs=8
    %%
    ^\h+      out() << "| "; // nodent: text is aligned to current indent
    ^\h+\i    out() << "> "; // indent: matched and added with \i
    ^\h*\j    out() << "< "; // dedent: matched with \j
    \j        out() << "< "; // dedent: for each extra level dedented
    .|\n      echo();
    %%
~~~
</div>

The `\h` pattern matches space and tabs, where tabs advance to the next column
that is a multiple of 8.  The tab multiplier can be changed by setting the
`‚àí‚àítabs=N` option where `N` must be 1 (no expansion), 2, 4, or 8.  The tabs
value can be changed at runtime with `matcher().tabs(N)`:

  RE/flex action      | Result
  ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
  `matcher().tabs()`  | returns the current tabs value 1, 2, 4, or 8
  `matcher().tabs(n)` | set the tabs value `n` where `n` is 1, 2, 4, or 8

Using negative patterns we can ignore empty lines and multi-line comments that
would otherwise affect indent stops:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %o main tabs=8
    %%
    ^\h+                      out() << "| "; // nodent, text is aligned to current margin column
    ^\h+\i                    out() << "> "; // indent
    ^\h*\j                    out() << "< "; // dedent
    \j                        out() << "< "; // dedent, for each extra level dedented
    (?^^\h*\n)                // eat empty lines without affecting indent stops
    (?^^\h*"/*"(.|\n)*?"*/")  // eat /*-comments that start a line without affecting indent stops
    (?^\\\n\h*)               // lines ending in \ continue on the next line
    (?^"/*"(.|\n)*?"*/")      // eat /*-comments
    .|\n                      echo(); // ECHO character
    %%
~~~
</div>

Likewise, we can add rules to ignore inline `//`-comments to our lexer
specification.  To do so, we should add a rule with pattern `(?^^\h*"//".*)` to
ignore `//`-comments without affecting stop positions.

To scan input that continues on the next new line(s) (which may affect indent
stops) while preserving the current indent stop positions, use the RE/flex
matcher `matcher().push_stops()` and `matcher().pop_stops()`, or
`matcher().stops()` to directlye access the vector of indent stops to modify:

  RE/flex action             | Result
  -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------
  `matcher().push_stops()`   | push indent stops on the stack then clear stops
  `matcher().pop_stops()`    | pop indent stops and make them current
  `matcher().clear_stops()`  | clear current indent stops
  `matcher().stops()`        | reference to current `std::vector<size_t>` stops
  `matcher().last_stop()`    | returns the last indent stop position or 0
  `matcher().insert_stop(n)` | inserts/appends an indent stop at position `n`
  `matcher().delete_stop(n)` | remove stop positions from position `n` and up

For example, to continue scanning after a `/*` for multiple lines without
indentation matching, allowing for possible nested `/*`-comments, up to a `*/`
you can save the current indent stop positions and transition to a new start
condition state to scan the content between `/*` and `*/`:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      int level;                 // a variable to track the /*-comment nesting level
      std::vector<size_t> stops; // a variable to save the stop positions after indent
    %}
    %o tabs=8
    %x COMMENT
    %%
    ^\h+           out() << "| ";               // nodent, text is aligned to current margin column
    ^\h+\i         out() << "> ";               // indent
                   stops = matcher().stops();   // save the stop positions
    ^"/*"\j        level = 1;                   // do not count dedent(s) to the first line that has a /*-comment
                   start(COMMENT);              // skip comment
    ^\h*\j         out() << "< ";               // dedent
    \j             out() << "< ";               // dedent, triggered for each extra level dedented
    (?^^\h*\n)     // a negative pattern to eat empty lines without affecting indent stops
    (?^^\h+/"/*")  // a negative pattern to eat white space before /*-comments without affecting indent stops
    "/*"           level = 1;
                   start(COMMENT);              // continue w/o indent matching
    (?^\\\n\h*)    // lines ending in \ continue on the next line
    .|\n           echo();                      // ECHO character
    <COMMENT>{
    "/*"           ++level;                     // allow nested /*-comments 
    "*/"           if (--level == 0)
                   {
                     matcher().stops() = stops; // restore the indent margin/tab stops
                     start(INITIAL);            // back to initial state
                   }
    .|\n           // ignore all content in comments
    <<EOF>>        out() << "/* not closed";
    }
    %%
~~~
</div>

The multi-line comments enclosed in `/*` `*/` are processed by the exclusive
`COMMENT` start condition rules.  The rules allow for `/*`-comment nesting.
We use `stops = matcher().stops()` and `matcher().stops() = stops` to save and
restore stops.

In this example we added rules so that comments on a line do not affect the
current indent stops.  This is done by using the negative pattern
`(?^^\h+/"/*")` with a trailing context `/"/*"`.  Here we used a negative
pattern to eat the margin spacing without affecting indent stops.  The trailing
context looks ahead for a `/*` but does not consume the `/*`.

However, when a `/*`-comment starts at the first column of a line, the pattern
`(?^^\h+/"/*")` does not match it, even when we change it to `(?^^\h*/"/*")`.
This is because the `\h*` cannot be an empty match since the trailing context
does not return a match, and matches cannot be empty.  Therefore, adding the
rule with pattern `^"/*"\j` adjusts for that, but accepting the dedents caused
by the `/*`-comment.  This is fine, because  the stop positions are restored
after scanning the `/*`-comment.

We added the negative pattern `(?^^\h*\n)` to ignore empty lines.  This allows
empty lines in the input without affecting indent stops.

@warning When using the `matcher().stops()` method to access the vector of
stops to modify, we must make sure to keep the stop positions in the vector
sorted.

In addition to the `\i` and `\j` indent and dedent anchors, the `\k` undent
anchor matches when the indent depth changed (before the position of `\k`),
undoing this change to keep the current indent stops ("undenting"):

  Pattern | Matches
  ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------
  `\k`    | undent: matches when indent depth changed, keep current indent stops

The example shown above can be simplified with `\k`.  We no longer need to
explicitly save and restore indent stops in a variable:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      int level;   // a variable to track the /*-comment nesting level
    %}
    %o tabs=8
    %x COMMENT
    %%
    ^\h+           out() << "| ";    // nodent, text is aligned to current margin column
    ^\h+\i         out() << "> ";    // indent
    ^\h*\j         out() << "< ";    // dedent
    \j             out() << "< ";    // dedent, triggered for each extra level dedented
    (?^^\h*\n)     // a negative pattern to eat empty lines without affecting indent stops
    \h*"/*"\k?     level = 1;        // /*-comment after spacing, \k matches indent stop changes
                   start(COMMENT);   // continue w/o indent matching
    (?^\\\n\h*)    // lines ending in \ continue on the next line
    .|\n           echo();           // ECHO character
    <COMMENT>{
    "/*"           ++level;          // allow nested /*-comments 
    "*/"           if (--level == 0)
                     start(INITIAL); // back to initial state
    .|\n           // ignore all content in comments
    <<EOF>>        out() << "/* not closed";
    }
    %%
~~~
</div>

The pattern `\h*"/*"\k?` matches a `/*`-comment with leading white space.  The
`\k` anchor matches if the indent depth changed in the leading white space,
which is also matched by the first three patterns in the lexer specification
before their `\i` and `\j` indent and dedent anchors, respectively.  If the
indent depth changed, the `\k` anchor matches, while keeping the current indent
stops unchanged by undoing these changes.  Because we also want to match `\*`
when the indent depth does not change, we made `\k` optional in pattern
`\h*"/*"\k?`.  The anchor `^` is not used here either, since comments after any
spacing should be matched.  Alternatively, two patterns `^\h*"/*"\k` and
`\h*"/*"` may be used, where the first matches if and only if the indent stops
changed on a new line and were undone.

Note that the `COMMENT` rules do not use `\i` or `\j`.  This means that the
current indent stops are never matched or changed and remain the same as in the
`INITIAL` state, when returning to the `INITIAL` state.

Another use of `\k` is to ignore indents to only detect a closing dedent with
`\j`.  For example, when comments are allowed to span multiple lines when
indented below the start of the `#` comment:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %x COMMENT MORECOM
    %%
    ^\h+\i         // indent
    ^\h*\j         // dedent
    \j             // dedent
    ^\h+           // nodent
    #.*\n          start(COMMENT);
    <COMMENT>{
    ^\h+\i         start(MORECOM);
    .|\n           matcher().less(0); start(INITIAL);
    }
    <MORECOM>{
    ^\h*\j         |
    \j             start(INITIAL);
    ^\h+\k         // undent, i.e. ignore all indents in comments
    .|\n           // ignore all content in comments
    }
    .|\n           echo();
    %%
~~~
</div>

The `COMMENT` state checks for an indent to switch to state `MORECOM`, which
eats the indented comment block.  When there is no indent `.|\n` is matched,
i.e. something must be matched.  This match is put back into the input with
`matcher().less(0)` (or `yyless(0)` with `‚àí‚àíflex`).

Alternatively, the indent level in the `COMMENT` rules could be tracked by
incrementing a variable when matching `\i` and decrementing the variable when
matching `\j` until the variable is zero at the final dedent.

@note Anchors `\i`, `\j`, and `\k` should appear at the end of a regex pattern.

\ref reflex-pattern-negative for more information on negative patterns.

### Negative patterns                                {#reflex-pattern-negative}

When negative patterns of the form `(?^œÜ)` match, they are simply ignored by
the matcher and never returned as matches.  They are useful to return matches
for some given pattern except when this pattern is more specific.  For example,
to match any sequence of digits except digits starting with a zero the pattern
`\d+|(?^0\d+)` can be used instead of `[1-9]\d+`.  While these two patterns may
look similar at first glance, these two patterns differ in that the first
pattern (with the negative sub-pattern `(?^0\d+)`) ignores numbers with leading
zeros such as `012` while the second pattern will match the `12` in `012`.

As another example, say we are searching for a given word while ignoring
occurrences of the word in quoted strings.  We can use the pattern
`word|(?^".*?")` for this, where `(?^".*?")` matches all quoted strings that we
want to ignore (to skip C/C++ quoted strings in source code input files, use
the longer pattern `(?^"(\\.|\\\r?\n|[^\\\n"])*")`).

A negative pattern can also be used to consume line continuations without
affecting the indentation stops defined by indent marker `\i`.  Negative
patterns are a RE/flex feature.  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %o tabs=8
    %%
    ^\h+         out() << "| "; // nodent: text is aligned to current indent
    ^\h*\i       out() << "> "; // indent: matched and added with \i
    ^\h*\j       out() << "< "; // dedent: matched with \j
    \j           out() << "< "; // dedent: for each extra level dedented
    (?^\\\n\h+)  /* lines ending in \ will continue on the next line
                    without affecting the current \i stop positions */
    .|\n         echo();
    %%
~~~
</div>

The negative pattern `(?^\\\n\h+)` consumes input internally as if we are
repeately calling `input()` (or `yyinput()` with `‚àí‚àíflex`).  We used it here to
consume the line-ending `\` and the indent that followed it, as if this text
was not part of the input, which ensures that the current indent positions
defined by `\i` are not affected.  See \ref reflex-pattern-dents for more
details on indentation matching.

@note Negative patterns may be preceded or followed by any pattern, which
enlarges the negative pattern.  That is, the pattern `X(?^Y)` equals `(?^XY)`
and the pattern `(?^Y)Z` equals `(?^YZ)`.  At least one character should be
matched in a negative pattern for the pattern to be effective.  For example,
`X(?^Y)?` matches `X` but not `XY`, which is the same as `X|(?^XY)`.

@warning Actions corresponding to negative patterns in the lexer specification
are never executed, because negative pattern matches are never returned by the
matcher engine.

### Lookahead                                       {#reflex-pattern-lookahead}

A lookahead pattern `œÜ(?=œà)` matches `œÜ` only when followed by pattern `œà`.
The text matched by `œà` is not consumed.

Boost.Regex and PCRE2 matchers support lookahead `œÜ(?=œà)` and lookbehind
`œÜ(?<=œà)` patterns that may appear anywhere in a regex.  The RE/flex matcher
supports lookahead at the end of a pattern, similar to \ref
reflex-pattern-trailing.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Lookbehind                                     {#reflex-pattern-lookbehind}

A lookbehind pattern `œÜ(?<=œà)` matches `œÜ` only when it also matches pattern
`œà` at its end (that is, `.*(?<=ab)` matches anything that ends in `ab`).

The RE/flex matcher does not support lookbehind.  Lookbehind patterns should
not look too far behind, see \ref reflex-limitations.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Trailing context                                 {#reflex-pattern-trailing}

Flex "trailing context" `œÜ/œà` matches a pattern `œÜ` only when followed by the
lookahead pattern `œà`.  A trailing context `œÜ/œà` has the same meaning as the
lookahead `œÜ(?=œà)`, see \ref reflex-pattern-lookahead.

A trailing context can only be used in lexer specifications and should only
occur at the end of a pattern, not in the middle of a pattern.  There are some
important \ref reflex-limitations to consider that are historical and related
to the construction of efficient FSMs for regular expressions.  The limitations
apply to trailing context and lookaheads that the RE/flex matcher implements.

### Unicode mode                                      {#reflex-pattern-unicode}

Use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíunicode` (or <i>`%%option unicode`</i>) to
globally enable Unicode.  Use `(?u:œÜ)` to locally enable Unicode in a pattern
`œÜ`.  Use `(?-u:œÜ)` to locally disable Unicode in `œÜ`.  Unicode mode enables
the following patterns to be used:

  Pattern            | Matches
  ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------
  `.`                | matches any character (or byte in Unicode mode, see \ref invalid-utf)
  `‚Ç¨` (UTF-8)        | matches wide character `‚Ç¨`, encoded in UTF-8
  `[‚Ç¨¬•¬£]` (UTF-8)    | matches wide character `‚Ç¨`, `¬•` or `¬£`, encoded in UTF-8
  `\X`               | matches any ISO-8859-1 or Unicode character
  `\R`               | matches a Unicode line break `\r\n` or `[\u{000A}-\u{000D}u{U+0085}\u{2028}\u{2029}]`
  `\s`               | matches a white space character `[ \t\n\v\f\r\p{Z}]`
  `\l`               | matches a lower case letter with Unicode sub-property Ll
  `\u`               | matches an upper case letter with Unicode sub-property Lu
  `\w`               | matches a Unicode word character with property L, Nd, or Pc
  `\u{20AC}`         | matches Unicode character U+20AC
  `\p{C}`            | matches a character in category C
  `\p{^C}`,`\P{C}`   | matches any character except in category C

When converting regex patterns for use with a C++ regex library, use regex
matcher converter flag `reflex::convert_flag::unicode` to convert Unicode
patterns for use with the 8-bit based RE/flex, Boost.Regex, PCRE2, and
std::regex regex libraries, see \ref regex-convert for more details.

### Free space mode                                 {#reflex-pattern-freespace}

Free space mode can be useful to improve readability of patterns.  Free space
mode permits spacing between concatenations and alternations in patterns.  To
to match a single space use `[ ]`, to match a tab use `[\t]`, to match either
use `\h`.  Long patterns may continue on the next line when the line ends with
an escape `\`.  Comments are ignored in patterns in free-space mode.  Comments
start with a `#` and end at the end of the line.  To specify a `#` use `[#]`.

In addition, `/*...*/` comments are permitted in lexer specifications in
free-space mode when the `‚àí‚àímatcher=reflex` option is specified (the default
matcher).

Free space mode requires lexer actions in \ref reflex-spec-rules of a lexer
specification to be placed in <i>`{ }`</i> blocks and user code to be placed in
<i>`%{ %}`</i> blocks instead of indented.

To enable free space mode in <b>`reflex`</b> use the `‚àí‚àífreespace` option (or
<i>`%%option freespace`</i>).

Prepend `(?x)` to the regex to specify free-space mode or use `(?x:œÜ)` to
locally enable free-space mode in the sub-pattern `œÜ`.  Use `(?-x:œÜ)` to
locally disable free-space mode in `œÜ`.  The regex pattern may require
conversion when the regex library does not support free-space mode modifiers,
see \ref regex-convert for more details.

### Multi-line mode                                 {#reflex-pattern-multiline}

Multi-line mode makes the anchors `^` and `$` match the start and end of a
line, respectively.  Multi-line mode is the default mode in lexer
specifications.

Prepend `(?m)` to the regex to specify multi-line mode or use `(?m:œÜ)` to
locally enable multi-line mode in the sub-pattern `œÜ`.  Use `(?-m:œÜ)` to
locally disable multi-line mode in `œÜ`.

### Dotall mode                                        {#reflex-pattern-dotall}

To enable dotall mode in <b>`reflex`</b> use the `-a` or `‚àí‚àídotall` option (or
<i>`%%option dotall`</i>).

Prepend `(?s)` to the regex to specify dotall mode or use `(?s:œÜ)` to locally
enable dotall mode in the sub-pattern `œÜ`.  Use `(?-s:œÜ)` to locally disable
dotall mode in `œÜ`.  The regex pattern may require conversion when the regex
library does not support dotall mode modifiers, see \ref regex-convert for more
details.

### Case-insensitive mode                             {#reflex-pattern-anycase}

To enable case-insensitive mode in <b>`reflex`</b> use the `-i` or
`‚àí‚àícase-insensitive` option (or <i>`%%option case-insensitive`</i>).

Prepend `(?i)` to the regex to specify case-insensitive mode or use `(?i:œÜ)` to
locally enable case-insensitive mode in the sub-pattern `œÜ`.  Use `(?-i:œÜ)` to
locally disable case-insensitive mode in `œÜ`.  The regex pattern may require
conversion when the regex library does not support non-ASCII Unicode
case-insensitive mode modifiers, see \ref regex-convert for more details.

### Multiple mode modifiers                         {#reflex-pattern-modifiers}

Multiple `(?i:œÜ)` \ref reflex-pattern-anycase, `(?m:œÜ)`
\ref reflex-pattern-multiline, `(?s:œÜ)` \ref reflex-pattern-dotall, `(?u:œÜ)`
\ref reflex-pattern-unicode, and `(?x:œÜ)` \ref reflex-pattern-freespace
modifiers may be applied to the same pattern `œÜ` by combining them in one
inline modifier `(?imsux-imsux:œÜ)`, where the mode modifiers before the dash
are enabled and the mode modifiers after the dash are disabled.

### Group captures                                   {#reflex-pattern-captures}

The PCRE and Boost regex libraries support group captures.  This feature can be
used with RE/flex using named captures.  Only named captures can be used and
the names must be unique among all lexer patterns, because a single regex
pattern is compiled that combines all lexer rules (numeric group captures
would apply globally across all rules, which is confusing.)  For PCRE, Perl
matching is required since PCRE POSIX matching does not support group captures.
A named group is defined with `(?<name>pattern)` and back-referenced with
`\g{name}`.  The subpattern matched by a name can be retrieved in a lexer rule
as follows:

~~~{.cpp}
    const char *name = "name"; // the group name
    std::pair<const char*,size_t> subpattern; // the subpattern in the input with its size
    std::pair<size_t,const char*> id = matcher().group_id();
    while (id.first != 0 && (id.second == NULL || strcmp(id.second, name) != 0))
      id = matcher().group_next_id();
    if (id.first != 0)
      subpattern = matcher()[id.first]; // found (the name was matched)
~~~

The Lexer/yyFlexLexer class                                     {#reflex-lexer}
---------------------------

By default, <b>`reflex`</b> produces a Lexer class with a virtual lex scanner
function.  The name of this function as well as the Lexer class name and the
namespace can be set with options:

  Option      | RE/flex default name | Flex default name
  ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------
  `namespace` | *n/a*                | *n/a* 
  `lexer`     | `Lexer` class        | `yyFlexLexer` class
  `lex`       | `lex()` function     | `yylex()` function

To customize the Lexer class use these options and code injection.

You can declare multiple nested namespace names by
`namespace=NAME1::NAME2::NAME3`, or by separating the names with a dot such as
`namespace=NAME1.NAME2.NAME3`, to declare the lexer in `NAME1::NAME2::NAME3`.

To understand the impact of these options, consider the following lex
specification template with upper case names represening the parts specified by
the user:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option namespace=NAMESPACE
    %option lexer=LEXER
    %option lex=LEX
    %option params=PARAMS

    %class{
      MEMBERS
    }

    %option ctorarg="CTORARG1, CTORARG2, ..."
    %option ctorinit="CTORINIT1, CTORINIT2, ..."
    %init{
      INIT
    }

    %begin{
      BEGIN
    }

    %%

    %{
      CODE
    %}

    REGEX  ACTION

    %%
~~~
</div>

This produces the following Lexer class with the template parts filled in:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/abslexer.h>

To use a custom lexer class that inherits the generated base Lexer class, use
option `‚àí‚àíclass=NAME` to declare the name of your custom lexer class (or option
`‚àí‚àíyyclass=NAME` to also enable `‚àí‚àíflex` compatibility with the `yyFlexLexer`
class).  For details, see \ref reflex-inherit.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)


Inheriting Lexer/yyFlexLexer                                  {#reflex-inherit}
----------------------------

To define a custom lexer class that inherits the generated Lexer or the
yyFlexLexer class, use option `‚àí‚àíclass=NAME` or option `‚àí‚àíyyclass=NAME`,
respectively.  Note that `‚àí‚àíyyclass=NAME` also enables option `‚àí‚àíflex` and
therefore enables Flex specification syntax.

When a `‚àí‚àíclass=NAME` or `‚àí‚àíyyclass=NAME` option is specified with the name of
your custom lexer class, <b>`reflex`</b> generates the `lex()` (or `yylex()`) method
code for your custom lexer class.  The custom lexer class should declare a
public `int lex()` method (or `int yylex()` method with option
`‚àí‚àíyyclass=NAME`).  Otherwise, C++ compilation of your custom class will fail.

For example, the following bare-bones custom Lexer class definition simply
inherits Lexer and declares a public `int lex()` method:
  
<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option class=MyLexer

    %{
      class MyLexer : public Lexer {
       public:
        int lex();
      };
    %}
~~~
</div>

The `int MyLexer::lex()` method code is generated by <b>`reflex`</b> for this lexer
specification.

Options `‚àí‚àílexer=NAME` and `‚àí‚àílex=NAME` may be combined with `‚àí‚àíclass=NAME` to
change the name of the inherited Lexer class and change the name of the `lex()`
method, respectively.

When using option `‚àí‚àíyyclass=NAME` the inherited lexer is `yyFlexLexer`.  The
custom lexer class should declare a public `yylex()` method similar to Flex.
For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option yyclass=MyLexer

    %{
      class MyLexer : public yyFlexLexer {
       public:
        int yylex();
      };
    %}
~~~
</div>

The `int MyLexer::yylex()` method code is generated by <b>`reflex`</b> for this
lexer specification.

Combining multiple lexers                                    {#reflex-multiple}
-------------------------

To rename a lexer class to combine multiple lexers in one application, use the
`‚àí‚àílexer=NAME` option.  This option renames the generated lexer class to avoid
lexer class name clashes.  Use this option in combination with option
`‚àí‚àíheader-file` to output a header file with the lexer class declaration to
include in your application source code.

In addition, use option `‚àí‚àíprefix=NAME` to output the generated code in file
<i>`lex.NAME.cpp`</i> instead of the standard <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i> to avoid name
clashes.  This option also affect the `‚àí‚àíflex` option by generating
`xxFlexLexer` with a `xxlex()` method when option `‚àí‚àíprefix=xx` is specified.
The generated `#define` names (some of which are added to support option
`‚àí‚àíflex`) are prefixed to avoid macro name clashes.

Alternatively to `‚àí‚àílexer=NAME` and `‚àí‚àíprefix=NAME`, you can use
`‚àí‚àínamespace=NAME` to place the generated lexer class in a C++ namespace to
avoid lexer class name clashes.  Note that unlike the `‚àí‚àíprefix=NAME` option,
the generated file names are not renamed by including `NAME` in the filename.
Generate the files in a separate subdirectory for each C++ namespace specified
with `‚àí‚àínamespace=NAME`.  Or you can explicitly specify the lex filename with
`‚àí‚àíoutfile=NAME` and also `‚àí‚àíheader-file=NAME` and ``‚àí‚àítables-file=NAME` when
header files and table files are used.

Switching input sources                                         {#reflex-input}
-----------------------

To create a Lexer class instance that reads from a designated input source
instead of standard input, pass the input source as the first argument to its
constructor and use the second argument to optionally set an `std::ostream`
that is assigned to `out()` and is used by `echo()` (likewise, assigned to
`*yyout` and used by `ECHO` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified):

~~~{.cpp}
    Lexer lexer(input, std::cout);
~~~

likewise, with option `‚àí‚àíflex`:

~~~{.cpp}
    yyFlexLexer lexer(input, std::cout);
~~~

where `input` is a `reflex::Input` object.  The `reflex::Input` constructor
takes a `FILE*` descriptor, `std::istream`, a string `std::string` or
`const char*`, or a wide string `std::wstring` or `const wchar_t*`.

@note The source of input specified to a lexer must remain readable while
scanning.  Do not pass temporary objects as input to the lexer constructor,
such as temporary `std::string` and `char*` strings.  The lexer reads the
specified input while scanning the input with subsequent `lex()` (and `yylex()`
etc.) calls.  The input source is copied in chunks of bytes to an internal
buffer, depending on the buffering mode.

The following methods are available to specify an input source:

  RE/flex action      | Flex action              | Result
  ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------
  `in()`              | `*yyin`                  | get pointer to current `reflex::Input i`
  `in() = i`          | `yyin = &i`              | set input `reflex::Input i`
  `in(i)`             | `yyrestart(i)`           | reset and scan input from `reflex::Input i`
  `in(s)`             | `yy_scan_string(s)`      | reset and scan string `s` (`std::string` or `char*`)
  `in(s)`             | `yy_scan_wstring(s)`     | reset and scan wide string `s` (`std::wstring` or `wchar_t*`)
  `in(b, n)`          | `yy_scan_bytes(b, n)`    | reset and scan `n` bytes at address `b` (buffered)
  `buffer(b, n+1)`    | `yy_scan_buffer(b, n+2)` | reset and scan `n` bytes at address `b` (zero copy)

For example, to switch input to another source while using the scanner, use
`in(i)` with `reflex::Input i` as an argument:

~~~{.cpp}
    // read from a file, this also decodes UTF-8/16/32 encodings automatically
    FILE *fd = fopen("cow.txt", "r");
    if (fd == NULL)
      ... // error, bail out
    lexer.in(fd);
    lexer.lex();

    // read from a stream (ASCII or UTF-8)
    std::istream i = std::ifstream("file", std::ios::in);
    lexer.in(i);
    lexer.lex();

    // read from a string (0-terminated, ASCII or UTF-8)
    lexer.in("How now brown cow.");
    lexer.lex();

    // read from a memory segment (raw bytes, ASCII, or UTF-8)
    const char *ptr = ...; // points to segment
    size_t len = ...;      // length of the memory segment
    lexer.in(ptr, len);
    lexer.lex();

    // read from a wide string, 0-terminated, encoding it to UTF-8 for matching
    lexer.in(L"How now brown cow.");
    lexer.lex();
~~~

You can assign new input with `in() = i`, which does not reset the lexer's
matcher.  This means that when the end of the input (EOF) is reached, and you
want to switch to new input, then you should clear the EOF state first with
`lexer.matcher().set_end(false)` to reset EOF.  Or use
`lexer.matcher().reset()` to clear the state.

Invoking `in(i)` resets the lexer's matcher (i.e. internally with
`matcher.reset()`).  This clears the line and column counters, resets the
internal anchor and boundary flags for anchor and word boundary matching, and
resets the matcher to consume buffered input.

These `in(i)` operations specify strings and bytes that are copied to an
internal buffer.  This is desirable, because the scanner uses a matcher that
initializes a buffer, block-wise copies more input to this internal buffer on
demand, and modifies this buffered content, e.g. to allow `text()` to return a
0-terminated `char` string.  Zero copy overhead is obtained with lexer method
`buffer(b, n)` to assign an external buffer:

~~~{.cpp}
    // read a 0-terminated buffer in place, buffer content is changed!!
    char *base = ...;  // points to the base address of the data
    size_t size = ...; // length of the data including one extra byte for a final \0
    lexer.buffer(base, size);
    lexer.lex();
~~~

@warning Function `buffer(b, n)` scans `n`-1 bytes at address `b`.  The length
`n` should include the final zero byte at the end of the string.

With options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` you can also use classic Flex functions:

~~~{.cpp}
    // read from a file, this also decodes UTF-8/16/32 encodings automatically
    FILE *fd = fopen("cow.txt", "r");
    if (fd == NULL)
      ... // error, bail out
    yyin = fd;
    yylex();

    // read from a stream (ASCII or UTF-8)
    std::istream i = std::ifstream("file", std::ios::in);
    yyin = &i;
    yylex();

    // read from a string (0-terminated, ASCII or UTF-8)
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER);
    yy_scan_string("How now brown cow."); // new buffer to scan a string
    // yyin = "How now brown cow.";       // alternative, does not create a new buffer
    yylex();

    // read from a memory segment (raw bytes, ASCII, or UTF-8)
    const char *ptr = ...; // points to memory segment
    size_t len = ...;      // length of the memory segment
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER);
    yy_scan_bytes(ptr, len); // new buffer to scan memory
    yylex();

    // read from a wide string, 0-terminated, encoding it to UTF-8 for matching
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER);
    yy_scan_wstring(L"How now brown cow."); // new buffer to scan a wide string
    // yyin = L"How now brown cow.";        // alternative, does not create a new buffer
    yylex();
~~~

The `yy_scan_string`, `yy_scan_bytes`, and `yy_scan_wstring` functions create
a new buffer (i.e. a new matcher in RE/flex) and replace the old buffer
without deleting it.  A pointer to the new buffer is returned, which becomes
the new `YY_CURRENT_BUFFER`.  You should delete the old buffer with
`yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER)` before creating a new buffer.

Zero copy overhead is obtained with `yy_scan_buffer(b, n)`:

~~~{.cpp}
    // read a 0-terminated buffer in place, buffer content is changed!!
    char *base = ...;  // points to 0-terminated buffer
    size_t size = ...; // length of the buffer including two final \0 bytes
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER);
    yy_scan_buffer(base, size);
    yylex();
~~~

@warning The Flex-compatible `yy_scan_buffer(b, n)` (when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is
used) scans `n`-2 bytes at address `b`.  The length `n` should include *two
final zero bytes at the end!*

@note Function `yy_scan_buffer(b, n)` only touches the first final byte and not
the second byte, since this function is the same as calling `buffer(b, n-1)`.
In fact, the specified string may have any final byte value.  The final byte of
the string will be set to zero when `text()` (or `yytext`) or `rest()` are
used.  But otherwise the final byte remains completely untouched by the other
lexer functions, including `echo()` (and Flex-compatible `ECHO`).  Only
`unput(c)`, `wunput()`, `text()` (or `yytext`), `rest()`, and `span()` modify
the buffer contents, where `text()` and `rest()` require an extra byte at the
end of the buffer to make the strings returned by these functions 0-terminated.
This means that you can scan read-only memory of `n` bytes located at address
`b` by using `buffer(b, n+1)` safely, for example to read read-only mmap(2)
`PROT_READ` memory, as long as `unput(c)`,`wunput()`, `text()` (or `yytext`),
`rest()`, and `span()` are not used.

The Flex `yy_scan_string`, `yy_scan_bytes`, `yy_scan_wstring`, and
`yy_scan_buffer` functions take an extra last `yyscan_t` argument for reentrant
scanners generated with option `‚àí‚àíreentrant`, for example:

~~~{.cpp}
    // read from a file, this also decodes UTF-8/16/32 encodings automatically
    FILE *fd = fopen("cow.txt", "r");
    if (fd == NULL)
      ... // error, bail out
    yyget_in(yyscanner) = fd;
    yylex();

    // read from a stream (ASCII or UTF-8)
    std::istream i = std::ifstream("file", std::ios::in);
    yyget_in(yyscanner) = &i;
    yylex();

    // read from a string (0-terminated, ASCII or UTF-8)
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER, yyscanner);
    yy_scan_string("How now brown cow.", yyscanner); // new buffer to scan a string
    yylex();

    // read from a memory segment (raw bytes, ASCII, or UTF-8)
    const char *ptr = ...; // points to memory segment
    size_t len = ...;      // length of the memory segment
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER, yyscanner);
    yy_scan_bytes(ptr, len, yyscanner); // new buffer to scan memory
    yylex();

    // read from a wide string, 0-terminated, encoding it to UTF-8 for matching
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER, yyscanner);
    yy_scan_wstring(L"How now brown cow.", yyscanner); // new buffer to scan a wide string
    yylex();

    // read a 0-terminated buffer in place, buffer content is changed!!
    char *base = ...;  // points to 0-terminated buffer
    size_t size = ...; // length of the buffer including final 0 byte
    yy_delete_buffer(YY_CURRENT_BUFFER, yyscanner);
    yy_scan_buffer(base, size, yyscanner);
    yylex();
~~~

The `yyscanner` macro is essentially the same is the `this` pointer
that can only be used in lexer methods and in lexer rules.
Outside the scope of lexer methods a pointer to your `yyFlexLexer lexer` object
should be used instead, for example `yyget_in(&lexer)`.  Also
`YY_CURRENT_BUFFER` should be replaced by `yyget_current_buffer(&lexer)`.
See also \ref reflex-reentrant.

Switching input before the end of the input source is reached discards all
remaining input from that source.  To switch input without affecting the
current input source, switch matchers instead.  The matchers buffer the input
and manage the input state, in addition to pattern matching the input.

The following methods are available to specify a matcher `Matcher m` (a Flex
"buffer") for a lexer:

  RE/flex action    | Flex action              | Result
  ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------
  `matcher(m)`      | `yy_switch_to_buffer(m)` | use matcher `m`
  `new_matcher(i)`  | `yy_create_buffer(i, n)` | returns new matcher for `reflex::Input i`
  `del_matcher(m)`  | `yy_delete_buffer(m)`    | delete matcher `m`
  `push_matcher(m)` | `yypush_buffer_state(m)` | push current matcher, then use `m`
  `pop_matcher()`   | `yypop_buffer_state()`   | pop matcher and delete current
  `ptr_matcher()`   | `YY_CURRENT_BUFFER`      | pointer to current matcher
  `has_matcher()`   | `YY_CURRENT_BUFFER != 0` | current matcher is usable

For example, to switch to a matcher that scans from a new input source, then
restores the old input source:

~~~{.cpp}
    ... // scanning etc.
    Matcher *oldmatcher = matcher();
    reflex::Input input(...);
    Matcher *newmatcher = new_matcher(input);
    matcher(newmatcher);
    ... // scan the new input
    del_matcher(newmatcher);
    matcher(oldmatcher);
    ... // continue scanning the old input
~~~

the same with the `‚àí‚àíflex` option becomes:

~~~{.cpp}
    ... // scanning etc.
    YY_BUFFER_STATE oldbuf = YY_CURRENT_BUFFER;
    reflex::Input input(...);
    YY_BUFFER_STATE newbuf = yy_create_buffer(input, YY_BUF_SIZE);
    yy_switch_to_buffer(newbuf);
    ... // scan the new input
    yy_delete_buffer(newbuf);
    ... // the specified input is no longer needed here
    yy_switch_to_buffer(oldbuf);
    ... // continue scanning the old input
~~~

This switches the scanner's input by switching to another matcher.  Note that
`matcher(m)` may be used by the virtual `wrap()` method (or `yywrap()` when
option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified) if you use input wrapping after EOF to set things
up for continued scanning.

Switching input sources (via either `matcher(m)`, `in(i)`, or the Flex
functions) does not change the current start condition state.

When the scanner reaches the end of the input, it will check the `int wrap()`
method to detetermine if scanning should continue.  If `wrap()` returns one (1)
the scanner terminates and returns zero to its caller.  If `wrap()` returns
zero (0) then the scanner continues.  In this case `wrap()` should set up a new
input source to scan.

For example, continuing reading from `std:cin` after some other input source
reached EOF:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %class{
      virtual int wrap() // note: yywrap() with option ‚àí‚àíflex
      {
        in(std::cin);
        return in().good() ? 0 : 1;
      }
    }
~~~
</div>

To implement a `wrap()` (and `yywrap()` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified) in a
derived lexer class with option `class=NAME` (or `yyclass=NAME`), override the
`wrap()` (or `yywrap()`) method as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option class=Tokenizer

    %{
      class Tokenizer : Lexer { // note: yyFlexLexer with option ‚àí‚àíflex
       public:
        virtual int wrap() // note: yywrap() with option ‚àí‚àíflex
        {
          in(std::cin);
          return in().good() ? 0 : 1;
        }
      };
    %}
~~~
</div>

You can override the `wrap()` method to set up a new input source when the
current input is exhausted.  Do not use `matcher().input(i)` to set a new input
source `i`, because that resets the internal matcher state.

With the `‚àí‚àíflex` options your can override the `yyFlexLexer::yywrap()` method
that returns an integer 0 (more input available) or 1 (we're done).

With the `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` options you should define a global `yywrap()`
function that returns an integer 0 (more input available) or 1 (we're done).  

To set the current input as interactive, such as input from a console, use
`matcher().interactive()` (`yy_set_interactive(1)` with option `‚àí‚àíflex`).  This
disables buffering of the input and makes the scanner responsive to direct
input.

To read from the input without pattern matching, use `matcher().input()` to
read one character at a time (8-bit, ASCII or UTF-8).  This function returns
EOF if the end of the input was reached.  But be careful, the Flex `yyinput()`
and `input()` functions return 0 instead of an `EOF` (-1)!

To put back one character unto the input stream, use `matcher().unput(c)` (or
`unput(c)` with option `‚àí‚àíflex`) to put byte `c` back in the input or
`matcher().wunput(c)` to put a (wide) character `c` back in the input.

@warning Functions `unput()` and `wunput()` invalidate the previous `text()`
and `yytext` pointers.  Basically, `text()` and `yytext` cannot be used after
`unput()`.

For example, to crudily scan a C/C++ multiline comment we can use the rule:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    "/*"    {  /* skip multiline comments */
      int c;
      while ((c = yyinput()) != 0)
      {
        if (c == '\n')
          ++mylineno;
        else if (c == '*')
        {
          if ((c = yyinput()) == '/')
            break;
          unput(c);
        }
      }
    }
~~~
</div>

We actually do not need to keep track of line numbers explicitly, because
`yyinput()` with RE/flex implicitly updates line numbers, unlike Flex from
which this example originates.

Instead of the crude approach shown above, a better alternative is to use a
regex `/\*.*?\*/` or perhaps use start condition states, see
\ref reflex-states.

A simpler and faster approach is to use `skip("*/")` to skip comments:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    "/*"    skip("*/");
~~~
</div>

Using `skip()` is fast and flushes the internal buffer when searching, unlike
`yyinput()` that maintains the buffer contents to keep `text()` (and `yytext`)
unchanged.

To grab the rest of the input as a string, use `matcher().rest()` which returns
a `const char*` string that points to the internal buffer that is enlarged to
contain all remaining input.  Copy the string before using the matcher again.

To read a number of bytes `n` into a string buffer `s[0..n-1]`, use
the virtual `matcher().get(s, n)` method.  This method is the same as invoking
`matcher().in.get(s, n)` to directly read data from the `reflex::Input` source
`in`, but also handles interactive input when enabled with
`matcher().interactive()` to not read beyond the next newline character.  The
`gets, n)` matcher method can be overriden by a derived matcher class to
customize reading.

The Flex `YY_INPUT` macro is not supported by RE/flex.  It is recommended to
use `YY_BUFFER_STATE` (Flex), which is a `reflex::FlexLexer::Matcher` class in
RE/flex that holds the matcher state and the state of the current input,
including the line and column number positions (so unlike Flex, `yylineno` does
not have to be saved and restored when switching buffers).  See also section
\ref reflex-spec on the actions to use.

To implement a custom input handler you can use a proper object-oriented
approach: create a derived class of `reflex::Matcher` (or another matcher
class derived from `reflex::AbstractMatcher`) and in the derived class override
the `size_t reflex::Matcher::get(char *s, size_t n)` method for input handling.
This function is called with a string buffer `s` of size `n` bytes.  Fill the
string buffer `s` up to `n` bytes and return the number of bytes stored in `s`.
Return zero upon EOF.  Use <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àímatcher=NAME` and
`‚àí‚àípattern=reflex::Pattern` to use your new matcher class `NAME` (or leave out
`‚àí‚àípattern` for Boost.Regex derived matchers).

The `FlexLexer` lexer class is the base class of the `yyFlexLexer` lexer class
generated with <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíflex`, which defines a virtual `size_t
LexerInput(char*, size_t)` method.  This virtual method can be redefined in the
generated `yyFlexLexer` lexer to consume input from some source of text:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %class{
      virtual size_t LexerInput(char *s, size_t n)
      {
        size_t k;
        // populate s[0..k-1] for some k with k <= n
        return k; // return number of bytes filled in s[]
      }
    }
~~~
</div>

This approach is compatible with Flex.  The `LexerInput` method may be invoked
multiple times by the matcher engine and should eventually return zero to
indicate the end of input is reached (e.g. when at EOF).

To prevent the scanner from initializing the input to `stdin` before reading
input with `LexerInput()`, use option `‚àí‚àínostdinit`.

Multiple input sources                                 {#reflex-multiple-input}
----------------------

A typical scenario for a compiler of a programming language is to process
`include` directives in the source input that should include the source of
another file before continuing with the current input.

For example, the following specification defines a lexer that processes
`#include` directives by switching matchers and using the stack of matchers to
permit nested `#include` directives up to a depth of as much as 99 files:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include <stdio.h>
    }

    %class{

      int depth;

      void include_file()
      {
        depth++;
        if (depth > 99)
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);           // max include depth exceeded
        char *q = strchr(text(), '"');  // get ..."filename"
        char *file = strdup(q + 1);     // get filename"
        file[strlen(file) - 1] = '\0';  // get filename
        FILE *fd = fopen(file, "r");
        free(file);
        if (!fd)
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);           // cannot open file
        push_matcher(new_matcher(fd));  // push current matcher, use new matcher
      }

      bool end_of_file()
      {
        if (depth == 0)
          return true;                  // return true: no more input to read
        fclose(in());                   // close current input in() (a FILE*)
        pop_matcher();                  // delete current matcher, pop matcher
        depth--;
        return false;                   // return false: continue reading
      }

    }

    %init{
      depth = 0;
    }

    %%

    ^\h*#include\h*\".*?\"    include_file();
    .|\n                      echo();
    <<EOF>>                   if (end_of_file()) return 0;

    %%
~~~
</div>

With option `‚àí‚àíflex`, the statement `push_matcher(new_matcher(fd))` above
becomes `yypush_buffer_state(yy_create_buffer(fd, YY_BUF_SIZE))` and
`pop_matcher()` becomes `yypop_buffer_state()`.  For comparison, here is a
C-based classic Flex example specification that works with RE/flex too:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      #include <stdio.h>
      int depth = 0;
    %}

    %%

    ^[ \t]*#include[ \t]*\".*?\"    {
        depth++;
        if (depth > 99)
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);           // max include depth exceeded
        char *q = strchr(yytext, '"');  // get ..."filename"
        char *file = strdup(q + 1);     // get filename"
        file[strlen(file) - 1] = '\0';  // get filename
        FILE *fd = fopen(file, "r");
        free(file);
        if (!fd)
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);           // cannot open file
        YY_BUFFER_STATE buf = yy_create_buffer(fd, YY_BUF_SIZE);
        yypush_buffer_state(buf);       // push current buffer, use new buffer
    }
    .|\n                      ECHO;
    <<EOF>>                   {
        fclose(yyin);                   // close current input
        yypop_buffer_state();           // delete current buffer, pop buffer
        if (!YY_CURRENT_BUFFER)         // no buffer, we're done
          yyterminate();
        depth--;
    }

Start condition states                                         {#reflex-states}
----------------------

Start conditions are used to group rules and selectively activate rules when
the start condition state becomes active.

A rule with a pattern that is prefixed with one ore more start conditions will
only be active when the scanner is in one of these start condition states.

For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    <A,B>pattern1    action1
    <A>pattern2      action2
    <B>pattern3      action3
~~~
</div>

When the scanner is in state `A` rules 1 and 2 are active. When the scanner
is in state `B` rules 1 and 3 are active.

Start conditions are declared in \ref reflex-spec-defs (the first section) of
the lexer specification using <i>`%%state`</i> or <i>`%%xstate`</i> (or
<i>`%%s`</i> and <i>`%%x`</i> for short) followed by a space-separated list of
names called *start symbols*.  Start conditions declared with `%%s` are
*inclusive start conditions*.  Start conditions declared with <i>`%%x`</i> are
*exclusive start conditions*:

If a start condition is inclusive, then all rules without a start condition and
rules with the corresponding start condition will be active.

If a start condition is exclusive, only the rules with the corresponding start
condition will be active.

When declaring start symbol names it is recommended to use all upper case to
avoid name clashes with other Lexer class members.  For example, we cannot use
`text` as a start symbol name because `text()` is a Lexer method.  When option
`‚àí‚àíflex` is specified, start symbol names are macros for compatibility with
Lex/Flex.

The scanner is initially in the `INITIAL` start condition state.  The `INITIAL`
start condtion is inclusive: all rules without a start condition and those
prefixed with the `INITIAL` start condition are active when the scanner is in
the `INITIAL` start condition state.

The special start condition prefix `<*>` matches every start condition.
The prefix `<*>` is not needed for `<<EOF>>` rules, because unprefixed
`<<EOF>>` rules are always active as a special case.  The `<<EOF>>` pattern and
this exception were originally introduced by Flex.

For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %s A
    %x X

    %%

    <A,X>pattern1    action1    // rule for states A and X
    <A>pattern2      action2    // rule for state A
    <X>pattern3      action3    // rule for state X
    <*>pattern4      action4    // rule for states INITIAL, A and X
    pattern5         action5    // rule for states INITIAL and A
    <<EOF>>          action6    // rule for states INITIAL, A and X

    %%
~~~
</div>

When the scanner is in state `INITIAL` rules 4, 5, and 6 are active.  When the
scanner is in state `A` rules 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are active.  When the scanner is
in state `X` rules 1, 3, 4, and 6 are active.  Note that `A` is inclusive
whereas `X` is exclusive.

To switch to a start condition state, use `start(START)` (or `BEGIN START` when
option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified).  To get the current state use `start()` (or
`YY_START` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified).  Switching start condition
states in your scanner allows you to create "mini-scanners" to scan portions of
the input that are syntactically different from the rest of the input, such as
comments:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %x COMMENT

    %%

    "/*"    start(COMMENT);    // with ‚àí‚àíflex use: BEGIN COMMENT;
    .|\n    echo();            // with ‚àí‚àíflex use: ECHO;

    <COMMENT>[^*]*         // eat anything that is not a '*'
    <COMMENT>"*"+[^*/]*    // eat '*'s not followed by a '/'
    <COMMENT>"*"+"/"       start(INITIAL);
    <COMMENT><<EOF>>       std::cerr << "EOF in comment\n"; return 1;

    %%
~~~
</div>

Start symbols are actually integer values, where `INITIAL` is 0.  This means
that you can store a start symbol value in a variable.  You can also push the
current start condition on a stack and transition to start condition `START`
with `push_state(START)`.  To transition to a start condition that is on the
top of the stack and pop it use `pop_state()`.  The `top_state()` returns the
start condition that is on the top of the stack:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %x COMMENT

    %%

    "/*"    push_state(COMMENT);
    .|\n    echo();

    <COMMENT>[^*]*         // eat anything that is not a '*'
    <COMMENT>"*"+[^*/]*    // eat '*'s not followed by a '/'
    <COMMENT>"*"+"/"       pop_state();
    <COMMENT><<EOF>>       std::cerr << "EOF in comment\n"; return 1;

    %%
~~~
</div>

When many rules are prefixed by the same start conditions, you can simplify
the rules by placing them in a *start condition scope*:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    <COMMENT>{
    [^*]*         // eat anything that is not a '*'
    "*"+[^*/]*    // eat '*'s not followed by a '/'
    "*"+"/"       start(INITIAL);
    <<EOF>>       std::cerr << "EOF in comment\n"; return 1;
    }
~~~
</div>

Start condition scopes may be nested.  A nested scope extends the scope of
start conditions that will be associated with the rules in the nested scope.

For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %s A
    %x X

    %%

    pattern    action    // rule for states INITIAL and A

    <A>{
    pattern    action    // rule for state A
    <X>{
    pattern    action    // rule for states A and X
    }
    }

    <X>{
    pattern    action    // rule for state X
    <A>{
    pattern    action    // rule for states A and X
    }
    }

    %%
~~~
</div>

Designating a start condition as inclusive or exclusive is effective only for
rules that are not associated with a start condition scope.  That is, inclusive
start condition states are implicitly associated with rules unless a rule has a
start condition scope that explicitly associates start condition states with
the rule.

RE/flex extends the syntax of start conditions scopes beyond Flex syntax,
allowing the removal of start conditions from the current scope.  A start
condition name prefixed with the `^` operator is removed from the current
scope:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %s A B C

    %%

    <B,C>{
    pattern    action    // rule for states B and C
    <A,^B>{
    pattern    action    // rule for states A and C
    }
    }

    <*,^A,^C>pattern    action    // rule for states INITIAL and B (all states except A and C)

    %%
~~~
</div>

Note that scopes should be read from outer to inner scope, and from left to
right in a `<...>` scope declaration.  This means that `<*,^A,^C>` first
extends the scope to include all start conditions and then removes `A` and `C`.

A start condition cannot be removed when it is not included in the current
scope.  For example, `<*,^A>` is correct but `<^A,*>` is incorrect when used as
a top-level scope.

Empty `<>` without start condition states cannot be specified because this is a
valid regex pattern.  To remove all states from a scope use `<^*>`.  This
construct is only useful when the empty scope is extended by start conditions
specified in sub-scopes.

@note Contrary to some Flex manuals, rules cannot be indented in a start
condition scope.  When a code block is indented at the begin of a start
condition scope it is considered an initial code block, see \ref
reflex-code-blocks.  All indented lines are considered actions.  Note that
<i>`%%option freespace`</i> allows patterns to be indented.  With this option
all action code blocks must be bracketed.

Initial code blocks                                       {#reflex-code-blocks}
-------------------

An initial code block may be placed at the start of the rules section or in a
condition scope.  This code block is executed each time the scanner is invoked
(i.e. when `lex()` or `yylex()` is called) before matching a pattern.  Initial
code blocks may be associated with start condition states as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %s A
    %x X

    %%

    %{
      // Code block for all inclusive states (INITIAL and A)
    %}
    pattern    action    // rule for states INITIAL and A
    ...
    pattern    action    // rule for states INITIAL and A

    <X>{
    %{
      // Code block for state X
    %}
    pattern    action    // rule for state X
    ...
    pattern    action    // rule for state X
    }

    <*>{
    %{
      // Code block for all inclusive and exclusive states (INITIAL, A, and X)
    %}
    pattern    action    // rule for states INITIAL, A, and X
    ...
    pattern    action    // rule for states INITIAL, A, and X
    }

    %%
~~~
</div>

Initial code blocks should be indented or should be placed within
<i>`%{ %}`</i> blocks.

An initial code block can be used to configure the lexer's matcher, since a
new matcher with the lexer patterns is created by the lexer just before the
rules are matched.  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %class{
      bool init_matcher;
    }

    %init{
      init_matcher = true;
    }

    %%

    %{
      if (init_matcher)            // init the new matcher?
      {
        init_matcher = false;      // init only once
        if (BUFFER_ALL)            // buffer all input at once?
          matcher().buffer();      // same as %option batch
        else if (INTERACTIVE)      // console-based (TTY) "interactive" input?
          matcher().interactive(); // same as %option interactive   
        matcher().tabs(4);         // same as %option tabs=4
      }
    %}
~~~
</div>

Interfacing with Bison/Yacc                                     {#reflex-bison}
---------------------------

The Bison tools generate parsers that invoke the global C function `yylex()` to
get the next token.  Tokens are integer values returned by `yylex()`.

To support Bison parsers use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíbison`.  This option
generates a scanner with a global lexer object `YY_SCANNER` and a global
`YY_EXTERN_C int yylex()` function.  When the Bison parser is compiled in C and
the scanner is compiled in C++, you must set `YY_EXTERN_C` in the lex
specification to `extern "C"` to enable C linkage rules:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include "y.tab.h"               /* include y.tab.h generated by bison */
      #define YY_EXTERN_C extern "C"   /* yylex() must use C linkage rules */
    }

    %option noyywrap bison

    %%

    [0-9]+               yylval.num = strtol(text(), NULL, 10);
                         return CONST_NUMBER;
    \"([^\\"]|\\")*\"    yylval.str = text();
                         return CONST_STRING;

    %%
~~~
</div>

Note that `‚àí‚àínoyywrap` may be specified to remove the dependency on the global
`yywrap()` function that is not defined.

This example sets the global `yylval.num` to the integer scanned or
`yylval.str` to the string scanned.  It assumes that the Bison/Yacc grammar
file defines the tokens `CONST_NUMBER` and `CONST_STRING` and the type
`YYSTYPE` of `yylval`.  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.y file) */

    %{
      extern int yylex(void);

    %union {         // YYSTYPE yylval is a union:
      int num;       // yylval.num
      char* str;     // yylval.str

`YYSTYPE` is a union defined by Bison or you can set it as an option
<i>`%%option YYSTYPE=type`</i> in a lexer specification.  

When option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified with `‚àí‚àíbison`, the `yytext`, `yyleng`,
and `yylineno` globals are accessible to the Bison/Yacc parser.  In fact, all
Flex actions and variables are globally accessible (outside \ref reflex-spec-rules
of the lexer specification) with the exception of `yy_push_state`,
`yy_pop_state`, and `yy_top_state` that are class methods.  Furthermore, `yyin`
and `yyout` are macros and cannot be (re)declared or accessed as global
variables, but these can be used as if they are variables to assign a new input
source and to set the output stream.  To avoid compilation errors when using
globals such as `yyin`, use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíheader-file` to generate a
header file <i>`lex.yy.h`</i> to include in your code.  Finally, in code
outside of \ref reflex-spec-rules you must use `yyinput()` instead of
`input()`, use the global action `yyunput()` instead of `unput()`, and use the
global action `yyoutput()` instead of `output()`.

See the generated <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i> "BISON" section, which contains
declarations specific to Bison when the `‚àí‚àíbison` option is specified.

There are two approaches for a Bison parser to work with a scanner.  Either the
Bison/Yacc grammar file should include the externs we need to import from the
scanner:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.y file) assuming C with externs defined by the scanner using YY_EXTERN_C */

    %{
      extern int yylex(void);
      extern char *yytext;
      extern yy_size_t yyleng;
      extern int yylineno;
    %}

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%
~~~
</div>

or a better approach is to generate a <i>`lex.yy.h`</i> header file with option
`‚àí‚àíheader-file` and use this header file in the Bison/Yacc grammar file:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.y file) for C++ */

    %{
      #include "lex.yy.h"
    %}

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%
~~~
</div>

The second option requires the generated parser to be compiled in C++, because
<i>`lex.yy.h`</i> contains C++ declarations.

@note The Flex macro `YY_DECL` is not supported by RE/flex.  The `YY_DECL`
macro is used or defined by Flex to redeclare the `yylex()` function signature,
See \ref YYDECL for more information.

### Bison and thread-safety                             {#reflex-bison-mt-safe}

Bison and Yacc are not thread-safe because the generated code uses and updates
global variables.  Yacc and Bison use the global variable `yylval` to exchange
token values.  By contrast, thread-safe reentrant Bison parsers pass the
`yylval` to the `yylex()` function as a parameter.  RE/flex supports all of
these Bison-specific features.

The following combinations of options are available to generate scanners for
Bison:

  Options                                         | Method                                                     | Global functions and variables

Option `‚àí‚àíprefix` may be used with option `‚àí‚àíflex` to change the prefix of the
generated `yyFlexLexer` and `yylex`.  This option may be combined with option
`‚àí‚àíbison` to also change the prefix of the generated `yytext`, `yyleng`, and
`yylineno`.

Furthermore, <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àínamespace=NAME`, `‚àí‚àílexer=LEXER` and
`‚àí‚àílex=LEX` can be used to add a C++ namespace, to rename the lexer class
(`Lexer` or `yyFlexLexer` by default) and to rename the lexer function (`lex`
or `yylex` by default), respectively.

For option `‚àí‚àíbison-complete` the lexer function return type is the parser's
`symbol_type` as defined in the Bison grammar specification.  The parser class
is specified with option `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser=PARSER` and an optional namespace
may be specified with `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME`.  The lexer function return
type may also be explicitly specified with option `‚àí‚àítoken-type=TYPE`.

The following sections explain the `‚àí‚àíbison-cc`, `‚àí‚àíbison-complete`, `‚àí‚àíbison-bridge`,
`‚àí‚àíbison-locations`, and `‚àí‚àíreentrant` options for <b>`reflex`</b>.

Additional parameters may be passed to `lex()` and `yylex()` by declaring
<i>`%%option params="extra parameters"`</i> in the lexer specification.
See \ref YYDECL.

### Bison-cc                                                 {#reflex-bison-cc}

The <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíbison-cc` expects a Bison 3.0
<i>`%%skeleton "lalr1.cc"`</i> C++ parser that is declared as follows in a
Bison grammar file:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.yxx file) for C++ */

    %require  "3.0"
    %skeleton "lalr1.cc"

    %code requires{
      namespace yy {
        class Lexer;  // Generated by reflex with namespace=yy lexer=Lexer lex=yylex
      }
    }

    %defines

    %parse-param { yy::Lexer& lexer }  // Construct parser object with lexer

    %code{
      #include "lex.yy.h"  // header file generated with reflex --header-file
      #undef yylex
      #define yylex lexer.yylex  // Within bison's parse() we should invoke lexer.yylex(), not the global yylex()
    }

    %union {      // yy::parser::semantic_type yylval is a union:
      int num;    // type of yylval.num is int
      char* str;  // type of yylval.str is char*
    }

    %token <num> CONST_NUMBER  // This defines yy::parser::token::CONST_NUMBER
    %token <str> CONST_STRING  // This defines yy::parser::token::CONST_STRING

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%

    void yy::parser::error(const std::string& msg)
    {
      std::cerr << msg << std::endl;
    }
~~~
</div>

With the `‚àí‚àíbison-cc` option of <b>`reflex`</b>, the `yylex()` function takes a
`yy::parser::semantic_type yylval` argument that makes the `yylval` visible
in the lexer rules to assign semantic values to.

The scanner is generated with <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àíbison-cc`,
`‚àí‚àínamespace=yy` and `‚àí‚àílexer=Lexer`.  The lexer specification should
`#include` the Bison-generated header file to ensure that the
`yy::parser::token` enums `CONST_NUMBER` and `CONST_STRING` are defined.

Using the code above, we can now initialize a Bison parser.  We first should
create a scanner and pass it to the `parser` constructor as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    yy::Lexer lexer(std::cin);  // read from stdin (or a stream, string or FILE)
    yy::parser parser(lexer);
    if (parser.parse() != 0)
      ... // error
~~~
</div>

We use options `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME` and `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser=NAME` to
specify the namespace and parser class name of the Bison 3.0
<i>`%%skeleton "lalr1.cc"`</i> C++ parser you are generating with Bison.  These
are `yy` and `parser` by default, respectively. For option
`‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME` the `NAME` can be a list of nested namespaces of
the form `NAME1::NAME2::NAME3` or by separating the names by a dot as in
`NAME1.NAME2.NAME3`.

### Bison-cc & locations                           {#reflex-bison-cc-locations}

The <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíbison-cc` with `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` expects a
Bison 3.0 <i>`%%skeleton "lalr1.cc"`</i> C++ parser that is declared as follows
in a Bison grammar file:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.yxx file) for C++ */

    %require  "3.0"
    %skeleton "lalr1.cc"

    %code requires{
      namespace yy {
        class Lexer;  // Generated by reflex with namespace=yy lexer=Lexer
      }
    }

    %defines

    %locations

    %parse-param { yy::Lexer& lexer }  // Construct parser object with lexer

    %code{
      #include "lex.yy.h"  // header file generated with reflex --header-file
      #undef yylex
      #define yylex lexer.yylex  // Within bison's parse() we should invoke lexer.yylex(), not the global yylex()
    }

    %union {      // yy::parser::semantic_type yylval is a union:
      int num;    // type of yylval.num is int
      char* str;  // type of yylval.str is char*
    }

    %token <num> CONST_NUMBER  // This defines yy::parser::token::CONST_NUMBER
    %token <str> CONST_STRING  // This defines yy::parser::token::CONST_STRING

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%

    void yy::parser::error(const location_type& loc, const std::string& msg)
    {
      std::cerr << msg << " at " << loc << std::endl;
    }
~~~
</div>

With the `‚àí‚àíbison-cc` and `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` options of <b>`reflex`</b>, the
`yylex()` function takes `yy::parser::semantic_type yylval` as the first
argument that makes the `yylval` visible in the lexer rules to assign semantic
values to.   The second argument `yy::location yylloc` is set automatically by
by invoking the lexer's `yylloc_update()` in `yylex()` to update the line and
column of the match.  The auto-generated virtual `yylloc_update()` method can
be overriden by a user-defined lexer class that extends `Lexer` (or extends
`yyFlexLexer` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified).

The scanner is generated with <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àíbison-cc`,
`‚àí‚àíbison-locations`, `‚àí‚àínamespace=yy` and `‚àí‚àílexer=Lexer`.  The lexer
specification should `#include` the Bison-generated header file to ensure that
the `yy::parser::token` enums `CONST_NUMBER` and `CONST_STRING` are defined.

Using the code above, we can now initialize a Bison parser.  We first should
create a scanner and pass it to the `parser` constructor as follows:

### Bison-complete                                     {#reflex-bison-complete}

The <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíbison-complete` expects a Bison 3.2 C++ parser
which uses both <i>`%%define api.value.type variant`</i> and
<i>`%%define api.token.constructor`</i>.  This parser defines the type
`symbol_type` variant and the parser expects `yylex` to have the type
`yy::parser::symbol_type  yylex()`.  Here is an example Bison 3.2 C++ complete
symbols grammar file:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.yxx file) for C++ */

    %require "3.2"
    %language "c++"

    %define api.namespace {yy}
    %define api.parser.class {parser}
    %define api.value.type variant
    %define api.token.constructor

    %defines
    %output "parser.cpp"

    %code requires{
      namespace yy {
        class Lexer;  // Generated by reflex with namespace=yy lexer=Lexer lex=yylex
      }
    }

    %parse-param { yy::Lexer& lexer }  // Construct parser object with lexer

    %code{
      #include "lex.yy.h"  // header file generated with reflex --header-file
      #undef yylex
      #define yylex lexer.yylex  // Within bison's parse() we should invoke lexer.yylex(), not the global yylex()
    }

    %define api.token.prefix {TOK_}
    %token <std::string> IDENTIFIER "identifier"  // This defines TOK_IDENTIFIER
    %token <int> NUMBER "number"                  // This defines TOK_NUMBER
    %token EOF 0 "end of file"                    // This defines TOK_EOF with value 0

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%

    void yy::parser::error(const std::string& msg)
    {
      std::cerr << msg << std::endl;
      if (lexer.size() == 0)      // if token is unknown (no match)
        lexer.matcher().winput(); // skip character
    }
~~~
</div>

With the `‚àí‚àíbison-complete` option of <b>`reflex`</b>, the `yylex()` function
takes no arguments by default and returns a value of type
`yy::parser::symbol_type`.  This means that the lexer's action should return
values of this type, constructed with `yy::parser::symbol_type` or with
`make_TOKENNAME` as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
    #include "parser.hpp"  /* Generated by bison. */
    }

    %option bison-complete
    %option bison-cc-namespace=yy
    %option bison-cc-parser=parser

    %option exception="yy::parser::syntax_error(\"Unknown token.\")"

    %option namespace=yy
    %option lexer=Lexer

    %%
    \s+      // skip space
    [a-z]+   return yy::parser::make_IDENTIFIER(str());
    [0-9]+   return yy::parser::make_NUMBER(atoi(text()));
    ":"      return yy::parser::symbol_type(':');
    <<EOF>>  return yy::parser::make_EOF();
    %%
~~~
</div>

The scanner is generated with <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àíbison-complete`,
`‚àí‚àínamespace=yy` and `‚àí‚àílexer=Lexer`.  Option `‚àí‚àíbison-complete` automatically
defines the appropriate token type `symbol_type` depending on
`‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace` and on `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser`.  We also used options
`‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME` and `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser=NAME` to specify the
namespace and parser class name of the Bison 3.2 C++ parser.  These are `yy`
and `parser` by default, respectively (<i>`%%define api.namespace {yy}`</i> and
<i>`%%define api.parser.class {parser}`</i> are actually superfluous in the
example grammer specification because their values are the defaults).  We use
option `‚àí‚àíexception` to specify that the scanner's default rule should
throw a `yy::parser::syntax_error("Unknown token.")`.  This exception is caught
by the parser which calls `yy::parser::error` with the string
`"Unknown token."` as argument.

We have to be careful with option `‚àí‚àíexception`.  Because no input is consumed,
the scanner should not be invoked again or we risk looping on the unmatched
input.  Alternatively, we can define a "catch all else" rule with pattern `.`
that consumes the offending input:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%
    \s+      // skip space
    [a-z]+   return yy::parser::make_IDENTIFIER(str());
    [0-9]+   return yy::parser::make_NUMBER(atoi(text()));
    ":"      return yy::parser::symbol_type(':');
    <<EOF>>  return yy::parser::make_EOF();
    .        throw yy::parser::syntax_error("Unknown token.");
    %%
~~~
</div>

For option `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME` the `NAME` may be a list of nested
namespaces of the form `NAME1::NAME2::NAME3` or by separating the names by a
dot as in `NAME1.NAME2.NAME3`.

Using the code above, we can now initialize a Bison parser in our main program.
We first should create a scanner and pass it to the `parser` constructor as
follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    yy::Lexer lexer(std::cin);  // read from stdin (or a stream, string or FILE)
    yy::parser parser(lexer);
    if (parser.parse() != 0)
      ... // error
~~~
</div>

Note that when the end of input is reached, the lexer returns
`yy::parser::make_EOF()` upon matching `<<EOF>>`.  This rule is optional.
When omitted, the return value is `yy::parser::symbol_type(0)`.

`symbol_type` variant and the parser expects `yylex` to have the type

      #define yylex lexer.yylex  // Within bison's parse() we should invoke lexer.yylex(), not the global yylex()
    }

    %define api.token.prefix {TOK_}
    %token <std::string> IDENTIFIER "identifier"  // This defines TOK_IDENTIFIER
    %token <int> NUMBER "number"                  // This defines TOK_NUMBER

      if (lexer.size() == 0)      // if token is unknown (no match)
        lexer.matcher().winput(); // skip character
    }
~~~
</div>

With the `‚àí‚àíbison-complete` option of <b>`reflex`</b>, the `yylex()` function
takes no arguments by default and returns a value of type
`yy::parser::symbol_type`.  This means that the lexer's action should return
values of this type, constructed with `yy::parser::symbol_type` or with
`make_TOKENNAME` as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
    #include "parser.hpp"    /* Generated by bison. */
    #include "location.hpp"  /* Generated by bison %locations. */
    }

    %option bison-complete
    %option bison-cc-namespace=yy
    %option bison-cc-parser=parser
    %option bison-locations

    %option exception="yy::parser::syntax_error(location(), \"Unknown token.\")"

    %option namespace=yy
    %option lexer=Lexer

    %%
    \s+      // skip space
    [a-z]+   return yy::parser::make_IDENTIFIER(str(), location());
    [0-9]+   return yy::parser::make_NUMBER(atoi(text()), location());
    ":"      return yy::parser::symbol_type(':', location());
    <<EOF>>  return yy::parser::make_EOF(location());
    %%
~~~
</div>

The scanner is generated with <b>`reflex`</b> options `‚àí‚àíbison-complete`,
`‚àí‚àíbison-locations`, `‚àí‚àínamespace=yy` and `‚àí‚àílexer=Lexer`.  Option
`‚àí‚àíbison-complete` automatically defines the appropriate token type
`symbol_type` depending on `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace` and on `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser`.
We also used options `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME` and `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-parser=NAME`
to specify the namespace and parser class name of the Bison 3.2 C++ parser.
These are `yy` and `parser` by default, respectively (i.e.
`%define api.namespace {yy}` and `%define api.parser.class {parser}` are
actually superfluous in the example grammer specification because their values
are the defaults).  We use option `‚àí‚àíexception` to specify that the scanner's
default rule should throw a
`yy::parser::syntax_error(location(), "Unknown token.")`.  This exception is
caught by the parser which calls `yy::parser::error` with the value of
`location()` and the string `"Unknown token."` as arguments.  The
auto-generated virtual lexer class method `location()` method may be overriden
by a user-defined lexer class that extends `Lexer` (or extends `yyFlexLexer`
when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified).

We have to be careful with option `‚àí‚àíexception`.  Because no input is consumed,
the scanner should not be invoked again or we risk looping on the unmatched
input.  Alternatively, we can define a "catch all else" rule with pattern `.`
that consumes the offending input:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%
    \s+      // skip space
    [a-z]+   return yy::parser::make_IDENTIFIER(str(), location());
    [0-9]+   return yy::parser::make_NUMBER(atoi(text()), location());
    ":"      return yy::parser::symbol_type(':', location());
    <<EOF>>  return yy::parser::make_EOF(location());
    .        throw yy::parser::syntax_error(location(), "Unknown token.");
    %%
~~~
</div>

For option `‚àí‚àíbison-cc-namespace=NAME` the `NAME` may be a list of nested
namespaces of the form `NAME1::NAME2::NAME3` or by separating the names by a
dot as in `NAME1.NAME2.NAME3`.

Using the code above, we can now initialize a Bison parser in our main program.
We first should create a scanner and pass it to the `parser` constructor as
follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    FILE *f = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (f != NULL)
    {
      yy::Lexer lexer(f);        // read file, decode UTF-8/16/32 format
      lexer.filename = filename; // the filename to display with error locations
      yy::parser parser(lexer);
      if (parser.parse() != 0)
        ... // error
~~~
</div>

Note that when the end of input is reached, the lexer returns
`yy::parser::make_EOF()` upon matching `<<EOF>>`.  This rule is optional.
When omitted, the return value is `yy::parser::symbol_type(0, location())`.

### Bison-bridge                                         {#reflex-bison-bridge}

The <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíbison-bridge` expects a Bison "pure parser" that
is declared as follows in a Bison grammar file:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.y file) for C or C++ */

    %{
      #include "lex.yy.h"
      #define YYPARSE_PARAM scanner
      #define YYLEX_PARAM   scanner
    %}

    %pure-parser

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%
~~~
</div>

@note `%%pure-parser` is deprecated and replaced with `%%define api.pure`.

With the `‚àí‚àíbison-bridge` option of <b>`reflex`</b>, the `yyscan_t` argument
type of `yylex()` is a `void*` type that passes the scanner object to this
global function (as defined by `YYPARSE_PARAM` and `YYLEX_PARAM`).  The
function then invokes this scanner's lex function.  This option also passes the
`yylval` value to the lex function, which is a reference to an `YYSTYPE` value.

Wtih the `‚àí‚àíbison-bridge` option two additional functions are generated that
should be used to create a new scanner and delete the scanner in your program:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    yyscan_t scanner = nullptr;
    yylex_init(&scanner);                // create a new scanner
    ...
    int token = yylex(&yylval, scanner); // scan with bison-bridge
    ...
    yylex_destroy(scanner);              // delete a scanner
    scanner = nullptr;
~~~
</div>

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)


### Bison-locations                                   {#reflex-bison-locations}

The option `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` expects a Bison parser with the locations
feature enabled.  This feature provides line and column numbers of the matched
text for error reporting.  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.y file) for C or C++ */

    %{
      #include "lex.yy.h"
      void yyerror(const char*);
    %}

    %locations

    %union {         // YYSTYPE yylval is a union:
      int num;       // type of yylval.num is int
      char* str;     // type of yylval.str is char*
    }

    %{
      /* reflex option ‚àí‚àíbison-locations makes yylex() take yylval and yylloc */
      extern int yylex(YYSTYPE*, YYLTYPE*);
      #define YYLEX_PARAM &yylval, &yylloc
    %}

    /* add &yylval and &yyloc parameters to yylex() with a trick: use YYLEX_PARAM */
    %lex-param { void *YYLEX_PARAM }

    %token <num> CONST_NUMBER
    %token <str> CONST_STRING

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%

    void yyerror(const char *msg)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "%s at %d,%d to line %d,%d\n",
          msg,
          yylloc.first_line,
          yylloc.first_column,
          yylloc.last_line,
          yylloc.last_column);
    }
~~~
</div>

The `yylval` value is passed to the lex function.  The `yylloc` structure is
automatically updated by the RE/flex scanner, so you do not need to define a
`YY_USER_ACTION` macro as you have to with Flex.  Instead, this is done
automatically in `yylex()` by invoking the lexer's `yylloc_update()` to update
the line and column of the match.  The auto-generated virtual `yylloc_update()`
method may be overriden by a user-defined lexer class that extends `Lexer` (or
extends `yyFlexLexer` when option `‚àí‚àíflex` is specified).

Note that with the `‚àí‚àíbison-location` option, `yylex()` takes an additional
`YYLTYPE` argument that a Bison parser provides.  You can set `YYLTYPE` as
an option <i>`%%option YYLTYPE=type`</i> in a lexer specification.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)


### Bison-bridge & locations                   {#reflex-bison-bridge-locations}

Here is a final example that combines options `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` and
`‚àí‚àíbison-bridge`,  The Bison parser should be a Bison pure-parser with
locations enabled:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    /* yacc grammar (.y file) for C or C++ */

    %{
      #include "lex.yy.h"
      void yyerror(YYLTYPE*, yyscan_t, const char*);
      #define YYPARSE_PARAM scanner
      #define YYLEX_PARAM   scanner
    %}

    %locations
    %pure-parser
    %lex-param { void *scanner }
    %parse-param { void *scanner }

    %union {         // YYSTYPE yylval is a union:
      int num;       // yylval.num
      char* str;     // yylval.str
    }

    %token <num> CONST_NUMBER
    %token <str> CONST_STRING

    %%
    ...  // grammar rules
    %%

    void yyerror(YYLTYPE *yylloc, yyscan_t scanner, const char *msg)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "%s at %d,%d to line %d,%d\n",
        msg,
        yylloc->first_line,
        yylloc->first_column,
        yylloc->last_line,
        yylloc->last_column);
    }
~~~
</div>

@note `%%pure-parser` is deprecated and replaced with `%%define api.pure`.

@note When Bison <i>`%%locations`</i> with <i>`%%define api.pure full`</i> is
used, `yyerror` has the signature `void yyerror(YYLTYPE *locp, char const
*msg)`.  This function signature is required to obtain the location information
with Bison pure-parsers.

@note Argument `yylval` is not a pointer but is passed by reference and should
be used as such in the scanner's rules.

@note Because `YYSTYPE` is declared by the parser, do not forget to add a
`#include "y.tab.h"` to the top of the specification of your lexer:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include "y.tab.h"    /* include y.tab.h generated by bison */
    }
~~~
</div>

With the `‚àí‚àíbison-bridge` and `‚àí‚àíbison-location` options two additional
functions are generated that should be used to create a new scanner and delete
the scanner in your program:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    yyscan_t scanner = nullptr;
    yylex_init(&scanner);      // create a new scanner
    ...
    int token = yylex(&yylval, &yylloc, scanner); // scan with bison-bridge and bison-locations
    ...
    yylex_destroy(scanner);    // delete a scanner
    scanner = nullptr;
~~~
</div>

### Reentrant scanners                                      {#reflex-reentrant}

Option `-R` or `‚àí‚àíreentrant` may be used to generate a reentrant scanner that
is compatible with reentrant Flex and Bison.  This is mainly useful when you
combine `‚àí‚àíreentrant` with `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison`.  See also \ref reflex-bison.

When using Bison with reentrant scanners, your code should create a `yyscan_t`
scanner object with `yylex_init(&scanner)` and destroy it with
`yylex_destroy(scanner)`.  Reentrant Flex functions take the scanner object as
an extra last argument, for example `yylex(scanner)`:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    yyscan_t scanner = nullptr;
    yylex_init(&scanner);       // create a new scanner
    ...
    int token = yylex(scanner); // reentrant scan
    ...
    yylex_destroy(scanner);     // delete a scanner
    scanner = nullptr;
~~~
</div>

Within a rules section we refer to the scanner with macro `yyscanner`, for
example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%
    {integer}    yylval.i = atoi(yyget_text(yyscanner));
                 return INTEGER;
    {decimal}    yylval.d = atof(yyget_text(yyscanner));
                 return DECIMAL;
    .            printf("unknown char at line %d\n", yyget_lineno(yyscanner));
    %%
~~~
</div>

The following functions are available in a reentrant Flex scanner generated
with options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíreentrant`.  These functions take an extra
argument `yyscan_t s` that is either `yyscanner` when the function is used in a
rule or in the scope of a lexer method, or is a pointer to the lexer object
when the function is used outside the scope of a lexer method:

  Reentrant Flex action       | Result
  --------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------
  `yyget_text(s)`             | 0-terminated text match
  `yyget_leng(s)`             | size of the match in bytes
  `yyget_lineno(s)`           | line number of the match (>=1)
  `yyset_lineno(n, s)`        | set line number of the match to `n`
  `yyset_columno(n, s)`       | set column number of the match to `n`
  `yyget_in(s)`               | get `reflex::Input` object
  `yyset_in(i, s)`            | set `reflex::Input` object
  `yyget_out(s)`              | get `std::ostream` object
  `yyset_out(o, s)`           | set output to `std::ostream o`
  `yyget_debug(s)`            | reflex option `-d` sets `n=1`
  `yyset_debug(n, s)`         | reflex option `-d` sets `n=1`
  `yyget_extra(s)`            | get user-defined extra parameter
  `yyset_extra(x, s)`         | set user-defined extra parameter
  `yyget_current_buffer(s)`   | the current matcher
  `yyrestart(i, s)`           | set input to `reflex::Input i`
  `yyinput(s)`                | get next 8-bit char from input
  `yyunput(c, s)`             | put back 8-bit char `c`
  `yyoutput(c, s)`            | output char `c`
  `yy_create_buffer(i, n, s)` | new matcher `reflex::Input i`
  `yy_delete_buffer(m, s)`    | delete matcher `m`
  `yypush_buffer_state(m, s)` | push current matcher, use `m`
  `yypop_buffer_state(s)`     | pop matcher and delete current
  `yy_scan_string(s)`         | scan string `s`
  `yy_scan_wstring(s)`        | scan wide string `s`
  `yy_scan_bytes(b, n)`       | scan `n` bytes at `b` (buffered)
  `yy_scan_buffer(b, n)`      | scan `n`-1 bytes at `b` (zero copy)
  `yy_push_state(n, s)`       | push current state, go to state `n`
  `yy_pop_state(s)`           | pop state and make it current
  `yy_top_state(s)`           | get top state start condition

With respect to the `yyget_extra` functions, a scanner object has a
`YY_EXTRA_TYPE yyextra` value that is user-definable.  You can define the type
in a lexer specification with the `extra-type` option:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option flex bison reentrant
    %option extra-type="struct extra"
    struct extra { ... }; // type of the data to include in a FlexLexer
~~~
</div>

This mechanism is somewhat crude as it originates with Flex' C legacy to add
extra user-defined values to a scanner class.  Because <b>`reflex`</b> is C++,
it is recommended to define a derived class that extends the `Lexer` or
`FlexLexer` class, see \ref reflex-inherit.

Because scanners are C++ classes, the `yyscanner` macro is essentially the same
is the `this` pointer.  Outside the scope of lexer methods a pointer to your
`yyFlexLexer lexer` object should be used instead.

### YY_DECL alternatives                                              {#YYDECL}

The Flex macro `YY_DECL` is not supported by RE/flex.  The `YY_DECL` macro is
typically used with FLex to (re)declare the `yylex()` function signature, for
example to take an additional `yylval` parameter that must be passed through
from `yyparse()` to `yylex()`.  Note that the standard cases are already
covered by RE/flex using options such as `‚àí‚àíbison-cc`, `‚àí‚àíbison-bridge` and
`‚àí‚àíbison-locations` that pass additional parameters to the scanner function
invoked by the Bison parser.

There are two better alternatives to `YY_DECL`:

1. Option <i>`%%option params="TYPE NAME, ..."`</i> can be defined in the lexer
   specification to pass additional parameters to the lexer function `lex()`
   and `yylex()`.  One or more corresponding Bison <i>%%param</i> declarations
   should be included in the grammar specification, to pass the extra
   parameters via `yyparse()` to `lex()`/`yylex()`.  Also `yyerror()` is
   expected to take the extra parameters.

2. The generated lexer class defined with <i>`%%class{ }`</i> can be extended
   with member declarations to hold state information, such as token-related
   values.  These values can then be exchanged with the parser by accessing
   them within the parser.

The first alternative matches the `YY_DECL` use cases.  The comma-separated
list of additional parameters <i>`"TYPE NAME, ..."`</i> are added to the end of
the parameter list of the generated `lex()`/`yylex()` function.  The second
alternative uses a stateful approach.  The values are stored in the scanner
object and can be made accessible beyond the scopes of the scanners's rule
actions and the parser's semantic actions.

See also \ref reflex-lexer.

Searching versus scanning                                      {#reflex-search}
-------------------------

RE/flex generates an efficient search engine with option `-S` (or `‚àí‚àífind`).
The generated search engine finds all matches while ignoring unmatched input
silently, which is different from scanning that matches all input piece-wise.

Searching with this option is more efficient than scanning with a "catch all
else" dot-rule to ignore unmatched input, as in:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    .    // no action, ignore unmatched input
~~~
</div>

The problem with this rule is that it is invoked for every single unmatched
character in the input, which is inefficient and slows down searching for
matching patterns significantly when more than a few unmatched characters are
encountered in the input.  Note that we cannot use `.+` to match longer
patterns because this overlaps with other patterns and is also likely longer
than the other patterns, i.e. the rule subsumes those patterns.

Unless the input contains relatively few unmatched characters or bytes to
ignore, option `-S` (or `‚àí‚àífind`) speeds up searching and matching
significantly.  This option applies the following optimizations to the RE/flex
FSM matcher:

- Hashing is used to match multiple strings, which is faster than multi-string
  matching with Aho-Corasick, Commentz-Walter, Wu-Manber, and other methods.

- Single short strings are searched with `memchr()`.  Single long strings are
  searched with Boyer-Moore-Horspool.  Also regex patterns with common prefixes
  are searched efficiently, e.g. the regex `reflex|regex|regular` has common
  prefix string `"re"` that is searched in the input first, then hashing is
  used to predict a match for the part after `"re"`, followed by regex matching
  with the FSM.

With option `-S` (or `‚àí‚àífind`), a "catch all else" dot-rule should not be
defined, since unmatched input is already ignored with this option and
defining a "catch all else" dot-rule actually slows down the search.

@note By contrast to option `-S` (or `‚àí‚àífind`), option `-s` (or `‚àí‚àínodefault`)
cannot be used to ignore unmatched input.  Option `-s` produces runtime errors
and exceptions for unmatched input.

This option only applies to the RE/flex matcher and can be combined with
options `-f` (or `‚àí‚àífull`) and `-F` (or `‚àí‚àífast`) to further increase
performance.

POSIX versus Perl matching                                 {#reflex-posix-perl}
--------------------------

The <b>`reflex`</b> scanner generator gives you a choice of matchers to use in
the generated scanner, where the default is the POSIX RE/flex matcher engine.
Other options are the Boost.Regex matcher in POSIX mode or in Perl mode.

To use a matcher for the generated scanner, use one of these three choices:

  Option          | Matcher class used  | Mode  | Engine      
  --------------- | ------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- 
  `-m reflex`     | `Matcher`           | POSIX | RE/flex lib (default choice)
  `-m pcre2-perl` | `PCRE2Matcher`      | Perl  | PCRE2
  `-m boost`      | `BoostPosixMatcher` | POSIX | Boost.Regex 
  `-m boost-perl` | `BoostPerlMatcher`  | Perl  | Boost.Regex 

The POSIX matchers look for the *longest possible match* among the given set of
alternative patterns.  Perl matchers look for the *first match* among the given
set of alternative patterns.

POSIX is generally preferred for scanners, since it is easier to arrange rules
that may have partially overlapping patterns.  Since we are looking for the
longest match anyway, it does not matter which rule comes first.  The order
does not matter as long as the length of the matches differ.  When matches are
of the same length because multiple patterns match, then the first rule is
selected.

Consider for example the following `lexer.l` specification if a lexer with
rules that are intended to match keywords and identifiers in some input text:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%

    int                     out() << "=> int keyword\n";
    interface               out() << "=> interface keyword\n";
    float                   out() << "=> float keyword\n";
    [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*    out() << "=> identifier\n";

    %%
~~~
</div>

When the input to the scanner is the text `integer`, a POSIX matcher selects
the last rule that matches it by *leftmost longest matching* policy.  This
matching policy selects the rule that matches the longest text.  If more than
one pattern matches the same length of text then the first pattern that matches
takes precedence.  This is what we want because it is an identifier in our
example programming language:

    reflex -m reflex ‚àí‚àímain lexer.l
    c++ -o lexer lex.yy.cpp -lreflex
    echo "integer" | ./lexer
    => identifier

By contrast, a Perl matcher uses a *greedy matching* policy, which selects the
first rule that matches.  In this case it matches the first part `int` of the
text `integer` and leaves `erface` to be matched next as an identifier:

    reflex -m boost-perl ‚àí‚àímain lexer.l
    c++ -o lexer lex.yy.cpp -lreflex -lboost_regex
    echo "integer" | ./lexer
    => int keyword
    => identifier

Note that the same greedy matching happens when the text `interface` is
encountered on the input, which we want to recognize as a separate keyword and
not match against `int`:

    reflex -m boost-perl ‚àí‚àímain lexer.l
    c++ -o lexer lex.yy.cpp -lreflex -lboost_regex
    echo "interface" | ./lexer
    => int keyword
    => identifier

Switching the rules for `int` and `interface` fixes that specific problem.

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%

    interface               out() << "=> interface keyword\n";
    int                     out() << "=> int keyword\n";
    float                   out() << "=> float keyword\n";
    [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*    out() << "=> identifier\n";

    %%
~~~
</div>

    reflex -m boost-perl ‚àí‚àímain lexer.l
    c++ -o lexer lex.yy.cpp -lreflex -lboost_regex
    echo "interface" | ./lexer
    => interface keyword

But we cannot do the same to fix matching `integer` as an identifier: when
moving the last rule up to the top we cannot match `int` and `interface` any
longer!

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%

    [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*    out() << "=> identifier\n";
    interface               out() << "=> interface keyword\n";
    int                     out() << "=> int keyword\n";
    float                   out() << "=> float keyword\n";

    %%
~~~
</div>

    reflex -m boost-perl ‚àí‚àímain lexer.l
    c++ -o lexer lex.yy.cpp -lreflex -lboost_regex
    echo "int" | ./lexer
    => identifier
    echo "interface" | ./lexer
    => identifier

Basically, a Perl matcher works in an *operational* mode by working the regex
pattern as a sequence of *operations* for matching, usually using backtracking
to find a matching pattern.

Perl matchers generally support lazy quantifiers and group captures, while most
POSIX matchers do not (e.g. Boost.Regex in POSIX mode does not support lazy
quantifiers).  The RE/flex POSIX matcher supports lazy quantifiers, but not
group captures.  The added support for lazy quantifiers and word boundary
anchors in RE/flex matching offers a reasonably new and useful feature for
scanners that require POSIX mode matching.

To prevent a Perl matcher from matching a keyword when an identifier starts
with the name of that keyword, we could use a lookahead pattern such as
`int(?=[^A-Za-z0-9_])` which is written in a lexer specification with a
trailing context `int/[^A-Za-z0-9_]` with the `/` lookahead meta symbol.

A POSIX matcher on the other hand is *declarative* with a deeper foundation
in formal language theory.  An advantage of POSIX matchers is that a regular
expression can always be compiled to a deterministic finite state machine for
efficient matching.

POSIX matching still requires the `int` matching rule before the identifier
matching rule, as in the original lexer specification shown in this section.
Otherwise an `int` on the input will be matched by the identifier rule.

Lookaheads can also be used with POSIX matchers to prioratize rules.  Adding
a lookahead lengthens the pattern while keeping only the part that matches
before the lookahead.  For example, the following lexer specification
attempts to remove leading `0` from numbers:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%

    0                       // no action
    [0-9]+                  out() << text() << std::endl;

    %%
~~~
</div>

However, in POSIX mode the first rule only matches if the text is exactly one
`0` because the second rule matches longer texts.  The trick here is to use a
trailing context with the first rule as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%

    0/[0-9]+                // no action
    [0-9]+                  out() << text() << std::endl;

    %%
~~~
</div>

    reflex -m reflex ‚àí‚àímain lexer.l
    c++ -o lexer lex.yy.cpp -lreflex
    echo "00123" | ./lexer
    => 123
    echo "0" | ./lexer
    => 0

Debugging and profiling                                         {#reflex-debug}
-----------------------

There are several <b>`reflex`</b> options to debug a lexer and analyze its
performance given some input text to scan:

- Option `-d` (or `‚àí‚àídebug`) generates a scanner that prints the matched text,
  which allows you to debug your patterns.

- Option `-p` (or `‚àí‚àíperf-report`) generates a scanner that profiles the
  performance of your lexer and the lexer rules executed, which allows you to
  find hotspots and performance bottlenecks in your rules.

- Option `-s` (or `‚àí‚àínodefault`) suppresses the default rule that echoes all
  unmatched text when no rule matches.  The scanner reports "scanner jammed"
  when no rule matches.  Without the `‚àí‚àíflex` option, a `std::runtime`
  exception is thrown.

- Option `-v` (or `‚àí‚àíverbose`) displays a summary of scanner statistics.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Debugging

Option `-d` generates a scnner that prints the matched text while scanning
input.  The output displayed is of the form:

    ‚àí‚àíaccepting rule at line NNN ("TEXT")

where NNN is the line number of the pattern in the lexer specification and TEXT
is the matched text.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Profiling

Option `-p` generates a scanner that profiles the performance of your lexer.
The performance report shows the performance statistics obtained for each
pattern defined in the lexer specification, i.e. the number of matches per
pattern, the total text length of the matches per pattern, and the total time
spent matching and executing the rule corresponding to the pattern.  The
performance profile statistics are collected when the scanner runs on some
given input.  Profiling allows you to effectively fine-tune the performance of
your lexer by focussing on patterns and rules that are frequently matched that
turn out to be computationally expensive.

This is perhaps best illustrated with an example.  The JSON parser
<i>`json.l`</i> located in the examples directory of the RE/flex download
package was built with reflex option `-p` and then run on some given JSON input
to analyze its performance:

    reflex 0.9.22 json.l performance report:
      INITIAL rules matched:
        rule at line 51 accepted 58 times matching 255 bytes total in 0.009 ms

        rule at line 69 accepted 8 times matching 25 bytes total in 0.006 ms
        rule at line 72 accepted 0 times matching 0 bytes total in 0 ms
        default rule accepted 0 times
      WARNING: execution times are relative:
        1) includes caller's execution time between matches when yylex() returns
        2) perf-report instrumentation adds overhead and increases execution times

The timings shown include the time of the pattern match and the time of the
code executed by the rule.  If the rule returns to the caller than the time
spent by the caller is also included in this timing.  For this example, we have
two start condition states namely INITIAL and STRING. The rule at line 52 is:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    [][}{,:]        { return yytext[0]; }
~~~
</div>

This returns a [ or ] bracket, a { or } brace, a comma, or a colon to the
parser.  Since the pattern and rule are very simple, we do not expect these to
contribute much to the 0.824 ms time spent on this rule.  The parser code
executed when the scanner returns could be expensive.  Depending on the
character returned, the parser constructs a JSON array (bracket) or a JSON
object (brace), and populates arrays and objects with an item each time a comma
is matched.  But which is most expensive? To obtain timings of these events
separately, we can split the rule up into three similar rules:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    [][]        { return yytext[0]; }
    [}{]        { return yytext[0]; }
    [,:]        { return yytext[0]; }
~~~
</div>

Then we use reflex option `-p`, recompile the generated scanner
<i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i> and rerun our experiment to see these changes:

        rule at line 52 accepted 2 times matching 2 bytes total in 0.001 ms
        rule at line 53 accepted 14 times matching 14 bytes total in 0.798 ms
        rule at line 54 accepted 42 times matching 42 bytes total in 0.011 ms

So it turns out that the construction of a JSON object by the parser is
relatively speaking the most expensive part of our application, when { and }
are encountered on the input. We should focus our optimization effort there if
we want to improve the overall speed of our JSON parser.

Examples                                                     {#reflex-examples}
--------

Some lexer specification examples to generate scanners with RE/flex.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Example 1

The following Flex specification counts the lines, words, and characters on the
input.  We use `yyleng` match text length to count 8-bit characters (bytes).

To build this example with RE/flex, use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíflex` to
generate Flex-compatible "yy" variables and functions.  This generates a C++
scanner class `yyFlexLexer` that is compatible with the Flex scanner class
(assuming Flex with option `-+` for C++).

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      #include <stdio.h>
      int ch = 0, wd = 0, nl = 0;
    %}

    %option noyywrap
    %option main

    nl      \r?\n
    wd      [^ \t\r\n]+

    %%

    {nl}    ch += yyleng; ++nl;
    {wd}    ch += yyleng; ++wd;
    .       ++ch;
    <<EOF>> printf("%8d%8d%8d\n", nl, wd, ch); yyterminate();

    %%
~~~
</div>

To generate a scanner with a global `yylex()` function similar to Flex in C
mode (i.e. without Flex option `-+`), use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíbison` with
the specification shown above.  This option when combined with `‚àí‚àíflex`
produces the global "yy" functions and variables.  This means that you can use
RE/flex scanners with Bison (Yacc) and with any other C code, assuming
everything is compiled together with a C++ compiler.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Example 2

An improved implementation drops the use of global variables in favor of Lexer
class member variables.  We also want to count Unicode letters with the `wd`
counter instead of ASCII letters, which are single bytes while Unicode UTF-8
encodings vary in size.  So we add the Unicode option and use `\w` to match
Unicode word characters.  Note that `.` (dot) matches Unicode, so the match
length may be longer than one character that must be counted.  We drop the
`‚àí‚àíflex` option and use RE/flex Lexer methods instead of the Flex "yy"
functions:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include <iostream>
      #include <iomanip>
      using namespace std;
    }

    %class{
      int ch, wd, nl;
    }

    %init{
      ch = wd = nl = 0;
    }

    %option unicode
    %option main
    %option full

    nl      \r?\n
    wd      (\w|\p{Punctuation})+

    %%

    {nl}    ch += size(); ++nl;
    {wd}    ch += size(); ++wd;
    .       ch += size();
    <<EOF>> out() << setw(8) << nl << setw(8) << wd << setw(8) << ch << endl;
            return 0;

    %%
~~~
</div>

This simple word count program differs slightly from the Unix wc utility,
because the wc utility counts words delimited by wide character spaces
(`iswspace`) whereas this program counts words made up from word characters
combined with punctuation.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Example 3

The following RE/flex specification filters tags from XML documents and verifies
whether or not the tags are properly balanced.  Note that this example uses the
lazy repetitions to keep the patterns simple.  The XML document scanned should
not include invalid XML characters such as `/`, `<`, or `>` in attributes
(otherwise the tags will not match properly).  The `dotall` option allows `.`
(dot) to match newline in all patterns, similar to the `(?s)` modifier in
regexes.

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include <stdio.h>
    }

    %class{
      int level;
    }

    %init{
      level = 0;
    }

    %o matcher=reflex dotall main
    %x ATTRIBUTES

    name                    [A-Za-z_:\x80-\xFF][-.0-9A-Za-z_:\x80-\xFF]*
    pi                      <\?{name}
    comment                 <!--.*?-->
    open                    <{name}
    close                   <\/{name}>
    cdata                   <!\[CDATA\[.*?]]>
    string                  \".*?\"|'.*?'

    %%

    {comment}               |
    {cdata}                 // skip comments and CDATA sections

    {pi}                    level++;
                            start(ATTRIBUTES);

    {open}                  printf("%*s%s\n", level++, "", text() + 1);
                            start(ATTRIBUTES);

    {close}                 matcher().less(size() - 1);
                            printf("%*s%s\n", --level, "", text() + 2);

    <<EOF>>                 printf("Tags are %sbalanced\n", level ? "im" : "");
                            return 0;

    <ATTRIBUTES>"/>"        --level;
                            start(INITIAL);

    <ATTRIBUTES>">"         start(INITIAL);

    <ATTRIBUTES>{name}      |
    <ATTRIBUTES>{string}    // skip attribute names and strings

    <*>.                    // skip anything else

    %%
~~~
</div>

Note thay we restrict XML tag names to valid characters, including all UTF-8
sequences that run in the range `\x80`-`\xFF` per 8-bit character.  This
matches all Unicode characters U+0080 to U+10FFFF.

The `ATTRIBUTES` state is used to scan attributes and their quoted values
separately from the `INITIAL` state.  The `INITIAL` state permits quotes to
freely occur in character data, whereas the `ATTRIBUTES` state matches quoted
attribute values.

We use `matcher().less(size() - 1)` to remove the ending `>` from the match in
`text()`.  The `>` will be matched again, this time by the `<*>.` rule that
ignores it.  We could also have used a lookahead pattern `"</"{name}/">"` where
`X/Y` means look ahead for `Y` after `X`.

### Example 4

This example Flex specification scans non-Unicode C/C++ source code.  It uses
free space mode to enhance readability.

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      #include <stdio.h>
    %}

    %o flex freespace main

    directive       ^ \h* # (. | \\ \r? \n)+
    name            [\u\l_] \w*
    udec            0 | [1-9] [0-9]*
    uhex            0 [Xx] [[:xdigit:]]+
    uoct            0 [0-7]+
    int             [-+]? ({udec} | {uhex}) \
                      ([Ll]{0,2} [Uu]? | [Uu] [Ll]{0,2})
    float           [-+] [0-9]* ([0-9] | \.[0-9] | [0-9]\.) [0-9]* \
                      ([Ee][-+]? [0-9]+)? \
                      [FfLl]?
    char            L? ' (\\. | [^\\\n'])* '
    string          L? \" (\\. | \\\r?\n | [^\\\n"])* \"

    %%

    \s+
    "//" .*? \n
    "/*" (.|\n)*? "*/"
    {directive}     { printf("DIRECTIVE %s\n", yytext); }
    {name}          { printf("NAME      %s\n", yytext); }
    {int}           { printf("INT       %s\n", yytext); }
    {float}         { printf("FLOAT     %s\n", yytext); }
    {char}          { printf("CHAR      %s\n", yytext); }
    {string}        { printf("STRING    %s\n", yytext); }
    [[:punct:]]     { printf("PUNCT     %s\n", yytext); }
    .               { printf("*** ERROR '%s' at line %d\n", yytext, yylineno); }

    %%
~~~
</div>

Free space mode permits spacing between concatenations and alternations.  To
match a single space, use `" "` or `[ ]`.  Long patterns can continue on the
next line(s) when lines ends with an escape `\`.

In free space mode you MUST place actions in <i>`{ }`</i> blocks and user code
in <i>`%{ %}`</i> blocks instead of indented.

When used with option `unicode`, the scanner automatically recognizes and scans
Unicode identifier names.  Note that we can use `matcher().columno()` or
`matcher().border()` in the error message to indicate the location on a line of
the match.  The `matcher().columno()` method takes tab spacing and wide
characters into account.  To obtain the byte offset from the start of the line
use `matcher().border()`.  The `matcher()` object associated with the Lexer
offers several other methods that Flex does not support.

### Example 5

This example defines a search engine to find C/C++ directives, such as
`#define` and `#include`, in the input fast.

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      #include <stdio.h>
    %}

    %o fast find main

    directive       ^\h*#(.|\\\r?\n)+

    %%

    {directive}     echo();

    %%
~~~
</div>

Option `%%o find` (`-S` or `‚àí‚àífind`) specifies that unmatched input text should
be ignored silently instead of being echoed to standard output, see
\ref reflex-search.  Option `%%fast` (`-F` or `‚àí‚àífast`) generates an efficient
FSM in direct code.

Limitations                                               {#reflex-limitations}
-----------

The RE/flex matcher engine uses an efficient FSM.  There are known limitations
to FSM matching that apply to Flex/Lex and therefore also apply to the
<b>`reflex`</b> scanner generator and to the RE/flex matcher engine:

- Lookaheads (trailing contexts) must appear at the end of a pattern when using
  the RE/flex matcher, so `a/b` (which is the same as lookahead
  `a(?=b)`) is permitted, but `(a/b)c` and `a(?=b)c` are not.
- Lookaheads cannot be properly matched when the ending of the first part of
  the pattern matches the beginning of the second part, such as `zx*/xy*`,
  where the `x*` matches the `x` at the beginning of the lookahead pattern.
  This is a common limitation that also Lex and Flex (with some ad-hoc
  exceptions) have.
- The POSIX Lex `REJECT` action is not supported.
- The POSIX Lex table size parameters `%p`, `%n`, `%a`, `%e`, `%k`, and `%o`
  are not supported; `%o` may also be used as a shorthand for `%option`.
- Flex translations <i>`%%T`</i> are not supported.
- Word boundaries `\<`, `\>`, `\b` and `\B` are supported by RE/flex using
  backtracking (since RE/flex version 3.4.1).  Except that option `‚àí‚àífast` does
  not produce code that backtracks, which means that patterns such as
  `bar.*\bfoo` that require backtracking on `\b` may not work properly.  If
  necessary, use option `‚àí‚àífull` when word boundaries are used when these
  require backtracking to find a match.

Some of these limitations may be removed in future versions of RE/flex.

Boost.Regex library limitations:

- Lookbehinds `œÜ(?<=œà)` with the Boost.Regex matcher engines should not look
  too far behind.  Any input before the current line may be discarded and is no
  longer available when new input is shifted into the internal buffer.  Only
  input on the current line from the start of the line to the match is
  guaranteed.
- Boost.Regex partial matching may fail to find the longest match when greedy
  repetition patterns such as `.*` are used.  Under certain conditions greedy
  repetitions may behave as lazy repetitions.  For example, the Boost.Regex
  engine may return the short match `abc` when the regex `a.*c` is applied to
  `abc abc`, instead of returning the full match `abc abc`.  The problem is
  caused by the limitations of Boost.Regex `match_partial` matching algorithm.
  To work around this limitation, we suggest to make the repetition pattern as
  specific as possible and not overlap with the pattern that follows the
  repetition.  *The easiest solution is to read the entire input* using
  <b>`reflex`</b> option `-B` (batch input).  For a stand-alone `BoostMatcher`,
  use the `buffer()` method.  We consider this Boost.Regex partial match
  behavior a bug, not a restriction, because *as long as backtracking on a
  repetition pattern is possible given some partial text, Boost.Regex should
  flag the result as a partial match instead of a full match.*

PCRE2 library limitations:

- Lookbehinds `œÜ(?<=œà)` with the PCRE2 matcher engines should not look too far
  behind.  Any input before the current line may be discarded and is no longer
  available when new input is shifted into the internal buffer.  Only input on
  the current line from the start of the line to the match is guaranteed.

The RE/flex regex library                                              {#regex}
=========================

The RE/flex regex library consists of a set of C++ templates and classes that
encapsulate regex engines in a standard API for scanning, tokenizing,
searching, and splitting of strings, wide strings, files, and streams.

The RE/flex regex library is a class hierarchy that has at the root an abstract
class `reflex::AbstractMatcher`.  Pattern types may differ between for matchers
so the `reflex::PatternMatcher` template class takes a pattern type and creates
a class that is complete except for the implementation of the `reflex::match()`
virtual method that requires a regex engine, such as PCRE2, Boost.Regex, or the
RE/flex engine.

To compile your application, simply include the applicable regex matcher of
your choice in your source code as we will explain in the next sections.  To
compile, link your application against the `libreflex` library:

    c++ myapp.cpp -lreflex

And optionally `-lpcre2-8` if you want to use PCRE2 for searching and matching:

    c++ myapp.cpp -lreflex -lpcre2-8

or `-lboost_regex` if you want to use Boost.Regex for searching and matching:

    c++ myapp.cpp -lreflex -lboost_regex

PCRE2 matcher classes                                            {#regex-pcre2}
---------------------

The `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` inherits `reflex::PatternMatcher<std::string>`.
The `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher` is derived from `reflex::PCRE2Matcher`:

  ![](classreflex_1_1_p_c_r_e2_matcher__inherit__graph.png)

An instance of `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` is initialized with a pattern that is
compiled with `pcre2_compile()` and `pcre2_jit_compile()` for optimal
performance with PCRE2 JIT-generated code.

An instance of `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher` creates a PCRE2 matcher with native
Unicode support, using PCRE2 options `PCRE2_UTF+PCRE2_UCP`.

PCRE2 is a powerful library.  The RE/flex regex API enhances this library with
operations to match, search, scan, and split data from a given input.  The
input may be a file, a string, or a stream.  Files that are UTF-8/16/32-encoded
are automatically decoded.  Further, streams can be of potentially unlimited
length because internal buffering is used by the RE/flex regex API enhancements
to efficiently apply PCRE2 partial pattern matching to streaming data.  This
enhancement permits pattern matching of interactive input from the console,
such that searching and scanning interactive input for matches will return
these matches immediately.

A `reflex::PCRE2Matcher` (or `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher`) engine is created from
a string regex and some given input:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h>

    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher( string, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

Likewise, a `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher` engine is created from a string regex and
some given input:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h>

    reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher matcher( string, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

This matcher uses PCRE2 native Unicode matching.  Non-UTF input is not
supported, such as plain binary.  UTF encoding errors in the input will cause
the matcher to terminate.

For input you can specify a string, a wide string, a file, or a stream object.

We use option `"N"` to permit empty matches when searching input with
`reflex::PCRE2Matcher::find`.

You can convert an expressive regex of the form defined in \ref reflex-patterns
to a regex that the PCRE2 engine can handle:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h>

    static const std::string regex = reflex::PCRE2Matcher::convert( string, [ flags ]);

    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher( regex, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

The converter is specific to the matcher selected, i.e.
`reflex::PCRE2Matcher::convert` and `reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher::convert`.
The former converter converts Unicode `\p` character classes to UTF-8 patterns,
converts bracket character classes containing Unicode, and groups UTF-8
multi-byte sequences in the regex string.  The latter converter does not
convert these regex constructs, which are matched by the PCRE2 engine
initialized with options `PCRE2_UTF+PCRE2_UCP`.

The converter throws a `reflex::regex_error` exception if conversion fails,
for example when the regex syntax is invalid.

To compile your application, link your application against the `libreflex`
library and `-lpcre2-8`:

    c++ myapp.cpp -lreflex -lpcre2-8

Boost matcher classes                                            {#regex-boost}
---------------------

The `reflex::BoostMatcher` inherits `reflex::PatternMatcher<boost::regex>`, and
in turn the `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher` and `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher` are both
derived from `reflex::BoostMatcher`:

  ![](classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher__inherit__graph.png)

An instance of `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher` is initialized with flag `match_perl`
and the flag `match_not_dot_newline`, these are `boost::regex_constants` flags.
These flags are the only difference with the plain `reflex::BoostMatcher`.

An instance of `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher` creates a POSIX matcher.  This means
that lazy quantifiers are not supported and the *leftmost longest rule* applies
to pattern matching.  This instance is initialized with the flags `match_posix`
and `match_not_dot_newline`.

Boost.Regex is a powerful library.  The RE/flex regex API enhances this library
with operations to match, search, scan, and split data from a given input.  The
input may be a file, a string, or a stream.  Files that are UTF-8/16/32-encoded
are automatically decoded.  Further, streams can be potentially of unlimited
length because internal buffering is used by the RE/flex regex API enhancements
to efficiently apply Boost.Regex partial pattern matching to streaming data.
This enhancement permits pattern matching of interactive input from the
console, such that searching and scanning interactive input for matches will
return these matches immediately.

@note The `reflex::BoostMatcher` extends the capabilities of Boost.Regex, which
does not natively support streaming input:

@note The Boost.Regex library requires the target text to be loaded into memory
for pattern matching.  It is possible to match a target text incrementally with
the `match_partial` flag and `boost::regex_iterator`.  Incremental matching can
be used to support matching on (possibly infinite) streams.  To use this method
correctly, a buffer should be created that is large enough to hold the text for
each match.  The buffer must adjust with a growing size of the matched text, to
ensure that long matches that do not fit the buffer are not discared.

@note Boost.Regex `Boost.IOStreams` with `regex_filter` loads the entire stream
into memory which does not permit pattern matching of streaming and interactive
input data.

A `reflex::BoostMatcher` (or `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher`) engine is created from
a `boost::regex` object, or string regex, and some given input for normal (Perl
mode) matching:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>

    reflex::BoostMatcher matcher( boost::regex or string, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

Likewise, a `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher` engine is created from a `boost::regex`
object, or string regex, and some given input for POSIX mode matching:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>

    reflex::BoostPosixMatcher matcher( boost::regex or string, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

For input you can specify a string, a wide string, a file, or a stream object.

We use option `"N"` to permit empty matches when searching input with
`reflex::BoostMatcher::find`.

You can convert an expressive regex of the form defined in \ref reflex-patterns
to a regex that the boost::regex engine can handle:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>

    static const std::string regex = reflex::BoostMatcher::convert( string, [ flags ]);

    reflex::BoostMatcher matcher( regex, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

The converter is specific to the matcher selected, i.e.
`reflex::BoostMatcher::convert`, `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher::convert`, and
`reflex::BoostPosixMatcher::convert`.  The converters also translates Unicode
`\p` character classes to UTF-8 patterns, converts bracket character classes
containing Unicode, and groups UTF-8 multi-byte sequences in the regex string.

The converter throws a `reflex::regex_error` exception if conversion fails,
for example when the regex syntax is invalid.

To compile your application, link your application against the `libreflex`
library and `-lboost_regex` depending on your Boost installation):

    c++ myapp.cpp -lreflex -lboost_regex

std::regex matcher classes                                         {#regex-std}
--------------------------

The `reflex::StdMatcher` class inherits `reflex::PatternMatcher<std::regex>` as
a base.  The `reflex::StdEcmaMatcher` and `reflex::StdPosixMatcher` are derived
classes from `reflex::StdMatcher`:

  ![](classreflex_1_1_std_matcher__inherit__graph.png)

An instance of `reflex::StdEcmaMatcher` is initialized with regex syntax option
`std::regex::ECMAScript`.  This is also the default std::regex syntax.

An instance of `reflex::StdPosixMatcher` creates a POSIX AWK-based matcher.  So
that lazy quantifiers are not supported and the *leftmost longest rule* applies
to pattern matching.  This instance is initialized with the regex syntax option
`std::regex::awk`.

The C++11 std::regex library does not support `match_partial` that is needed to
match patterns on real streams with an adaptive internal buffer that grows when
longer matches are made when more input becomes available.  Therefore all input
is buffered with the C++11 std::regex class matchers.

With respect to performance, as of this time of writing, std::regex matching is
much slower than other matchers, slower by a factor 10 or more.

The std::regex syntax is more limited than PCRE2, Boost.Regex, and RE/flex.
Also the matching behavior differs and cannot be controlled with mode
modifiers:

- `.` (dot) matches anything except `\0` (NUL);
- `\177` is erroneously interpreted as a backreference, `\0177` does not match;
- `\x7f` is not supported in POSIX mode;
- `\cX` is not supported in POSIX mode;
- `\Q..\E` is not supported;
- no mode modifiers `(?imsux-imsux:œÜ)`;
- no `\A`, `\z`, `\<` and `\>` anchors;
- no `\b` and `\B` anchors in POSIX mode;
- no non-capturing groups `(?:œÜ)` in POSIX mode;
- empty regex patterns and matcher option `"N"` (nullable) may cause issues
  (std::regex `match_not_null` appears not to work as documented);
- `interactive()` is not supported.

To work around these limitations that the std::regex syntax imposes, you can
convert an expressive regex of the form defined in section \ref reflex-patterns
to a regex that the std::regex engine can handle:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/stdmatcher.h>

    static const std::string regex = reflex::StdMatcher::convert( string, [ flags ]);

    reflex::StdMatcher matcher( regex, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

The converter is specific to the matcher selected, i.e.
`reflex::StdMatcher::convert`, `reflex::StdEcmaMatcher::convert`, and
`reflex::StdPosixMatcher::convert`.  The converters also translates Unicode
`\p` character classes to UTF-8 patterns, converts bracket character classes
containing Unicode, and groups UTF-8 multi-byte sequences in the regex string.

The converter throws a `reflex::regex_error` exception if conversion fails,
for example when the regex syntax is invalid.

To compile your application, link your application against the `libreflex`
and enable `std::regex` with `-std=c++11`:

    c++ -std=c++11 myapp.cpp -lreflex

The reflex::Matcher class                                      {#regex-matcher}
-------------------------

The RE/flex framework includes a POSIX regex matching library `reflex::Matcher`
that inherits the API from `reflex::PatternMatcher<reflex::Pattern>`:

  ![](classreflex_1_1_matcher__inherit__graph.png)

where the RE/flex `reflex::Pattern` class represents a regex pattern.  Patterns
as regex texts are internally compiled into deterministic finite state machines
by the `reflex::Pattern` class.  The machines are used by the `reflex::Matcher`
for fast matching of regex patterns on some given input.  The `reflex::Matcher`
is faster than the PCRE2 and Boost.Regex matchers.  The `reflex::FuzzyMatcher`
subclass is included and performs approximate regex pattern matching, see
\ref regex-fuzzy-matcher.

A `reflex::Matcher` engine is constructed from a `reflex::Pattern` object, or a
string regex, and some given input:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h>

    reflex::Matcher matcher( reflex::Pattern or string, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

The regex is specified as a string or a `reflex::Pattern` object, see
\ref regex-pattern below.

We use option `"N"` to permit empty matches when searching input with
`reflex::Matcher::find`.  Option `"T=8"` sets the tab size to 8 for
\ref reflex-pattern-dents matching.  Option `"W"` makes patterns match as
words, i.e. a non-word Unicode character precedes and follows the pattern (only
applies to `reflex::Matcher` and `reflex::FuzzyMatcher`.)

For input you can specify a string, a wide string, a file, or a stream object.

A regex string with Unicode patterns can be converted for Unicode matching as
follows:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h>

    static const std::string regex = reflex::Matcher::convert( string, [ flags ]);

    reflex::Matcher matcher( regex, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

The converter is specific to the matcher and translates Unicode `\p` character
classes to UTF-8 patterns, converts bracket character classes containing
Unicode, and groups UTF-8 multi-byte sequences in the regex string.

To compile your application, link your application against the `libreflex`:

    c++ myapp.cpp -lreflex

See \ref reflex-patterns for more details on regex patterns.

See \ref regex-input for more details on the `reflex::Input` class.

The reflex::FuzzyMatcher class                           {#regex-fuzzy-matcher}
------------------------------

The `reflex::FuzzyMatcher` class is derived from `reflex::Matcher` to support
approximate regex pattern matching.  The approximation error is contrained by
an "edit distance" which is one by default.  Instantiating a
`reflex::FuzzyMatcher` takes an optional `MAX` paramter to contrain the edit
distance permitted:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/fuzzymatcher.h>

    reflex::FuzzyMatcher matcher( reflex::Pattern or string, [MAX, ] reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

The instantiated `reflex::FuzzyMatcher` class supports the same methods and
features as the `reflex::Matcher` class, but with approximate pattern matching.

When a `MAX` parameter is specified, it may be combined with one or more of the following flags:

- `reflex::FuzzyMatcher::INS` insertions permit extra character(s) in the input
- `reflex::FuzzyMatcher::DEL` deletions permit missing character(s) in the input
- `reflex::FuzzyMatcher::SUB` substitutions count as one edit
- `reflex::FuzzyMatcher::BIN` ASCII/binary fuzzy matching, the default is Unicode (full Unicode matching requires the Unicode pattern converter shown further below)

For example, to allow approximate pattern matches to include up to three character insertions, but no deletions or substitutions (allowing insertions only is actually the most efficient fuzzy matching possible):

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::FuzzyMatcher matcher(regex, 3 | reflex::FuzzyMatcher::INS, INPUT);
~~~

To allow up to three insertions or deletions (note that a substitution counts as two edits: one insertion and one deletion):

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::FuzzyMatcher matcher(regex, 3 | reflex::FuzzyMatcher::INS | reflex::FuzzyMatcher::DEL, INPUT);
~~~

When no flags are specified with `MAX`, fuzzy matching is performed with insertions, deletions, and substitutions, each counting as one edit.

To support full Unicode fuzzy pattern matching, such as `\p` Unicode character classes, we first convert the regex pattern before using it as follows:

~~~{.cpp}
    std::string regex(reflex::Matcher::convert("PATTERN", reflex::convert_flag::unicode));
    reflex::FuzzyMatcher matcher(regex, [MAX,] INPUT);
~~~

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

The reflex::Pattern class                                      {#regex-pattern}
-------------------------

The `reflex::Pattern` class is used by the `reflex::matcher` for pattern
matching.  The `reflex::Pattern` class converts a regex pattern to an efficient
FSM and takes a regex string and options to construct the FSM internally.
The pattern instance is passed to a `reflex::Matcher` constructor:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h>

    [static] reflex:Pattern pattern(string [, "options"] )

    reflex::Matcher matcher(pattern, reflex::Input [, "options"] )
~~~

It may also be used to replace a matcher's current pattern, see \ref intro2.

To improve performance, it is recommended to create a `static` instance of the
pattern if the regex string is fixed.  This avoids repeated FSM construction at
run time.

The following options are combined in a string and passed to the
`reflex::Pattern` constructor:

  Option        | Effect
  ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------
  `b`           | bracket lists are parsed without converting escapes
  `e=c;`        | redefine the escape character
  `f=file.cpp;` | save finite state machine code to `file.cpp`
  `f=file.gv;`  | save deterministic finite state machine to `file.gv`
  `i`           | case-insensitive matching, same as `(?i)X`
  `m`           | multiline mode, same as `(?m)X`
  `n=name;`     | use `reflex_code_name` for the machine (instead of FSM)
  `q`           | Flex/Lex-style quotations "..." equals `\Q...\E`
  `r`           | throw regex syntax error exceptions, otherwise ignore errors
  `s`           | dot matches all (aka. single line mode), same as `(?s)X`
  `x`           | inline comments, same as `(?x)X`
  `w`           | display regex syntax errors before raising them as exceptions

The compilation of a `reflex::Pattern` object into a FSM may throw an exception
with option `"r"` when the regex string has problems:

~~~{.cpp}
    try
    {
      reflex::Pattern pattern(argv[1], "r"); // "r" option throws syntax error exceptions
      ...
      // code that uses the pattern object
      ...
    }
    catch (reflex::regex_error& e)
    {
      switch (e.code())
      {
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_parens:     std::cerr << "mismatched ( )"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_braces:     std::cerr << "mismatched { }"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_brackets:   std::cerr << "mismatched [ ]"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_quotation:  std::cerr << "mismatched \\Q...\\E quotation"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::empty_expression:      std::cerr << "regex (sub)expression should not be empty"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::empty_class:           std::cerr << "character class [...] is empty, e.g. [a&&[b]]"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_class:         std::cerr << "invalid character class name"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_class_range:   std::cerr << "invalid character class range, e.g. [Z-A]"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_escape:        std::cerr << "invalid escape character"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_anchor:        std::cerr << "invalid anchor or boundary"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_repeat:        std::cerr << "invalid repeat, e.g. {10,1}"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_quantifier:    std::cerr << "invalid lazy or possessive quantifier"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_modifier:      std::cerr << "invalid (?ismux:) modifier"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_collating:     std::cerr << "invalid collating element"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_backreference: std::cerr << "invalid backreference"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_syntax:        std::cerr << "invalid regex syntax"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::exceeds_length:        std::cerr << "exceeds length limit, pattern is too long"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::exceeds_limits:        std::cerr << "exceeds complexity limits, e.g. {n,m} range too large"; break;
      }
      std::cerr << std::endl << e.what();
    }
~~~

By default, the `reflex::Pattern` constructor solely throws the
`reflex::regex_error::exceeds_length` and `reflex::regex_error::exceeds_limits`
exceptions and silently ignores syntax errors.

Likewise, the `reflex::Matcher::convert`, `reflex::PCRE2Matcher::convert`,
`reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher::convert`, `reflex::BoostPerlMatcher::convert`,
`reflex::BoostMatcher::convert`, and `reflex::BoostPosixMatcher::convert`
functions may throw a `reflex_error` exception.  See the next section for
details.

The `reflex::Pattern` class has the following public methods:

  Method        | Result
  ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------
  `assign(r,o)` | (re)assign regex string `r` with string of options `o`
  `assign(r)`   | (re)assign regex string `r` with default options
  `=r`          | same as above
  `size()`      | returns the number of top-level sub-patterns
  `[0]`         | operator returns the regex string of the pattern
  `[n]`         | operator returns the `n`th sub-pattern regex string
  `reachable(n)`| true if sub-pattern `n` is reachable in the FSM

The assignment methods may throw exceptions, which are the same as the
constructor may throw.

The `reflex::Pattern::reachable` method verifies which top-level grouped
alternations are reachable.  This means that the sub-pattern of an alternation
has a FSM accepting state that identifies the sub-pattern.  For example:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h>

    reflex::Pattern pattern("(a+)|(a)", "r");
    std::cout << "regex = " << pattern[0] << std::endl;
    for (size_t i = 1; i <= pattern.size(); ++i)
      if (!pattern.reachable(i))
        std::cerr << pattern[i] << " is not reachable" << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    regex = (a+)|(a)
    (a) is not reachable

For this example regex, `(a)` is not reachable as the pattern is subsumed by
`(a+)`.  The `reflex::Matcher::accept` method will never return 2 when
matching the input `a` and always return 1, as per leftmost longest match
policy.  The same observation holds for the `reflex::Matcher::matches`,
`reflex::Matcher::find`, `reflex::Matcher::scan`, and `reflex::Matcher::split`
method and functors.  Reversing the alternations resolves this: `(a)|(a+)`.

@note The `reflex::Pattern` regex forms support capturing groups at the
top-level only, i.e. among the top-level alternations.

Regex converters                                               {#regex-convert}
----------------

To work around limitations of regex libraries and to support Unicode matching,
RE/flex offers converters to translate expressive regex syntax forms (with
Unicode patterns defined in section \ref reflex-patterns) to regex strings
that the selected regex engines can handle.

The converters translate `\p` Unicode classes, translate character
class set operations such as `[a-z‚àí‚àí[aeiou]]`, convert escapes such as `\X`,
and enable/disable `(?imsux-imsux:œÜ)` mode modifiers to a regex string that the
underlying regex library understands and can use.

Each converter is specific to the regex engine.  You can use a converter for
the matcher of your choice:

- `std::string reflex::Matcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with the RE/flex POSIX regex library;
- `std::string reflex::PCRE2Matcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with PCRE2;
- `std::string reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with PCRE2 native Unicode matching;
- `std::string reflex::BoostMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with Boost.Regex;
- `std::string reflex::BoostPerlMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with Boost.Regex in Perl mode;
- `std::string reflex::BoostPosixMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with Boost.Regex in POSIX mode;
- `std::string reflex::StdMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with C++ std::regex;
- `std::string reflex::StdEcmaMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with C++ std::regex in ECMA mode;
- `std::string reflex::StdPosixMatcher::convert(const std::string& regex, reflex::convert_flag_type flags)`
  converts an enhanced `regex` for use with C++ std::regex in POSIX mode;

where `flags` is optional.  When specified, it may be a combination of the
following `reflex::convert_flag` flags:

  Flag                               | Effect
  ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `reflex::convert_flag::none`       | no conversion
  `reflex::convert_flag::basic`      | convert basic regular expression syntax (BRE) to extended regular expression syntax (ERE)
  `reflex::convert_flag::unicode`    | `.`, `\s`, `\w`, `\l`, `\u`, `\S`, `\W`, `\L`, `\U` match Unicode, same as `(?u)`
  `reflex::convert_flag::recap`      | remove capturing groups and add capturing groups to the top level
  `reflex::convert_flag::lex`        | convert Flex/Lex regular expression syntax
  `reflex::convert_flag::u4`         | convert `\uXXXX` (shorthand for `\u{XXXX}`), may conflict with `\u` (upper case letter).
  `reflex::convert_flag::notnewline` | character classes do not match newline `\n`, e.g. `[^a-z]` does not match `\n`
  `reflex::convert_flag::permissive` | when used with `unicode`, produces a more compact FSM that tolerates some invalid UTF-8 sequences
  `reflex::convert_flag::closing`    | match a `)` literally without the presence of an opening `(`

The following `reflex::convert_flag` flags correspond to the common `(?imsx)`
modifiers.  These flags or modifiers may be specified, or both.  Modifiers are
removed from the converted regex if the regex library does not support them:

  Flag                              | Effect
  --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `reflex::convert_flag::anycase`   | convert regex to ignore case, same as `(?i)`
  `reflex::convert_flag::freespace` | convert regex by removing all freespace-mode spacing, same as `(?x)`
  `reflex::convert_flag::dotall`    | convert `.` (dot) to match all (match newline), same as `(?s)`
  `reflex::convert_flag::multiline` | adds/asserts if `(?m)` is supported for multiline anchors `^` and `$`

The following example enables Unicode matching by converting the regex pattern
with the `reflex::convert_flag::unicode` flag:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h> // reflex::Matcher, reflex::Input, reflex::Pattern

    // use a Matcher to check if sentence is in Greek:
    static const reflex::Pattern pattern(reflex::Matcher::convert("[\\p{Greek}\\p{Zs}\\pP]+", reflex::convert_flag::unicode));
    if (reflex::Matcher(pattern, sentence).matches())
      std::cout << "This is Greek" << std::endl;
~~~

The following example enables dotall mode to count the number of characters
(including newlines) in the given `example` input:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex

    // construct a Boost.Regex matcher to count wide characters:
    std::string regex = reflex::BoostMatcher::convert("(?su).");
    reflex::BoostMatcher boostmatcher(regex, example);
    size_t n = std::distance(boostmatcher.scan.begin(), boostmatcher.scan.end());
~~~

Note that we could have used `"\X"` instead to match any wide character without
using the `(?su)` modifiers.

A converter throws a `reflex::regex_error` exception if conversion fails, for
example when the regex syntax is invalid:

~~~{.cpp}
    std::string regex;
    try
    {
      regex = reflex::BoostMatcher::convert(argv[1], reflex::convert_flag::unicode));
    }
    catch (reflex::regex_error& e)
    {
      std::cerr << e.what();
      switch (e.code())
      {
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_parens:     std::cerr << "mismatched ( )"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_braces:     std::cerr << "mismatched { }"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_brackets:   std::cerr << "mismatched [ ]"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::mismatched_quotation:  std::cerr << "mismatched \\Q...\\E quotation"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::empty_expression:      std::cerr << "regex (sub)expression should not be empty"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::empty_class:           std::cerr << "character class [...] is empty, e.g. [a&&[b]]"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_class:         std::cerr << "invalid character class name"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_class_range:   std::cerr << "invalid character class range, e.g. [Z-A]"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_escape:        std::cerr << "invalid escape character"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_anchor:        std::cerr << "invalid anchor or boundary"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_repeat:        std::cerr << "invalid repeat, e.g. {10,1}"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_quantifier:    std::cerr << "invalid lazy or possessive quantifier"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_modifier:      std::cerr << "invalid (?ismux:) modifier"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_collating:     std::cerr << "invalid collating element"; break;
        case reflex::regex_error::invalid_backreference: std::cerr << "invalid backreference"; break;

Methods and iterators                                          {#regex-methods}
---------------------

The RE/flex abstract matcher, that every other RE/flex matcher inherits,
provides four operations for matching with an instance of a regex engine:

  Method      | Result
  ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `matches()` | returns nonzero if the input from begin to end matches
  `find()`    | search input and return nonzero if a match was found
  `scan()`    | scan input and return nonzero if input at current position matches
  `split()`   | return nonzero for a split of the input at the next match

These methods return a nonzero *"accept"* value for a match, meaning the
`size_t accept()` value that corresponds to a group capture (or one if no
groups are used).  The methods are repeatable, where the last three return
additional matches.

The `find`, `scan`, and `split` methods are also implemented as input iterators
that apply filtering tokenization, and splitting:

  Iterator range                  | Acts as a | Iterates over
  ------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------
  `find.begin()`...`find.end()`   | filter    | all matches
  `scan.begin()`...`scan.end()`   | tokenizer | continuous matches
  `split.begin()`...`split.end()` | splitter  | text between matches

### matches                                            {#regex-methods-matches}

The `matches()` method returns a nonzero "accept" value (the `size_t accept()`
group capture index value or the value 1 if no groups are used) if the given
input from begin to the end matches the specified pattern.

For example, to match a UUID string with PCRE2:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    std::string uuid = "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000";

    if (reflex::PCRE2Matcher("[0-9A-Fa-f]{8}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{12}", uuid).matches())
      std::cout << uuid << " is a string in UUID format" << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 is a string in UUID format

The `matches()` method returns the group capture index that can be used as a
selector.  For example:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    const char *food = "hotdog";

    switch (reflex::PCRE2Matcher("(.*cat.*)|(.*dog.*)", food).matches())
    {
      case 0: std::cout << food << " has not cat or dog" << std::endl;
              break;
      case 1: std::cout << food << " has a cat" << std::endl;
              break;
      case 2: std::cout << food << " has a dog" << std::endl;
              break;
    }
~~~

### find                                                  {#regex-methods-find}

The `find()` method and `find.begin()`...`find.end()` iterator range are used
to search for a match in the given input.

The `find()` method returns a nonzero "accept" value (the `size_t accept()`
group capture index value or the value 1 if no groups are used) for a match
and zero otherwise.

For example, to find all words in a string with PCRE2 on UTF-8 input using
`reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher`:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher, reflex::Input

    reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << matcher.text() << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    How
    now
    brown
    cow

The iterator range `find.begin()`...`find.end()` serves as an input filter.

For example, in C++11 we can use a range-based loop to loop over matches using
the `find` iterator:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher, reflex::Input

    for (auto& match : reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.").find)
      std::cout << match.text() << std::endl;
~~~

@note: we cannot generally simplify this loop to the following, because the
temporary matcher object is destroyed (some compilers handle this in C++23):

~~~{.cpp}
    for (auto& match : reflex::PCRE2UTFMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.").find);
      std::cout << "Found " << match.text() << std::endl;
~~~

Iterators can be used with algorithms and other iterator functions.  For
example to count words in a string:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
    std::cout << std::distance(matcher.find.begin(), matcher.find.end()) << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    4

The `find()` method returns the group capture index that can be used as a
selector.

See also \ref regex-methods-props.

### scan                                                  {#regex-methods-scan}

The `scan()` method and `scan.begin()`...`scan.end()` iterator range are
similar to `find` but generate continuous matches in the given input.

The `scan()` method returns a nonzero "accept" value (the `size_t accept()`
group capture index value or the value 1 if no groups are used) for a match
and zero otherwise.

For example, to scan for words, spacing, and punctuation in a sentence with
PCRE2:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    const char *tokens[4] = { "n/a", "word", "space", "other" };
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("(\\w+)|(\\s+)|(.)", "How now brown cow.");
    size_t accept;
    while ((accept = matcher.scan()) != 0)
      std::cout << tokens[accept] << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    word
    space
    word
    space
    word
    space
    word
    other

The iterator range `scan.begin()`...`scan.end()` serves as an input tokenizer
and produces continuous matches.

For example, tokenizing a string into a vector of numeric tokens:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("(\\w+)|(\\s+)|(.)", "How now brown cow.");
    std::vector<size_t> tokens(matcher.scan.begin(), matcher.scan.end());
    std::copy(tokens.begin(), tokens.end(), std::ostream_iterator<size_t>(std::cout, " "));
~~~

When executed the code prints:

    1 2 1 2 1 2 1 3

If the pattern does not match the input immediately succeeding a previous
match, then the `scan()` method returns false and the iterator returns
`scan.end()`.  To determine if all input was scanned and end of input was
reached, use the `at_end()` method, see \ref regex-methods-props.

See also \ref regex-methods-props.

### split                                                {#regex-methods-split}

The `split()` method and `split.begin()`...`split.end()` iterator range return
text between matches in the given input.

The `split()` method returns a nonzero "accept" value (the `size_t accept()`
group capture index value or the value 1 if no groups are used) of the
matching text (that is, the text that comes after the split part) and zero
otherwise.

When matches are adjacent then empty text is returned.  Also the start of input
and end of input return text that may be empty.

For example, to split text into words by matching non-words with PCRE2:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\W+", "How now brown cow.");
    while (matcher.split() != 0)
      std::cout << "'" << matcher.text() << "'" << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    'How'
    'now'
    'brown'
    'cow'
    ''

This produces five text splits where the last text is empty because the period
at the end of the sentence matches the pattern and empty input remains.

The iterator range `split.begin()`...`split.end()` serves as an input splitter.

For example, to display the contents of a text file while normalizing spacing:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h> // reflex::PCRE2Matcher, reflex::Input

    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\s+", fopen("abstract.txt", "r"));
    if (matcher.in.file() != NULL)
    {
      std::copy(matcher.split.begin(), matcher.split.end(), std::ostream_iterator<std::string>(std::cout, " "));
      fclose(matcher.in.file());
    }
~~~

@note The "accept" value of the last split is
`reflex::PCRE2Matcher::Const::EMPTY` to indicate that empty text after the
split was found and matched.  This special value is also returned by `accept()`
and is also used with any other RE/flex matcher's `split` method.

See also \ref regex-methods-props.

### Properties of a match                                {#regex-methods-props}

To obtain properties of a match, use the following methods:

  Method          | Result
  --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `accept()`      | returns group capture index (or zero if not captured/matched)
  `text()`        | returns `const char*` to 0-terminated text match (ends in `\0`)
  `strview()`     | returns `std::string_view` text match (preserves `\0`s) (C++17)
  `str()`         | returns `std::string` text match (preserves `\0`s)
  `wstr()`        | returns `std::wstring` wide text match (converted from UTF-8)
  `chr()`         | returns first 8-bit char of the text match (`str()[0]` as int)
  `wchr()`        | returns first wide char of the text match (`wstr()[0]` as int)
  `pair()`        | returns `std::pair<size_t,std::string>(accept(),str())`
  `wpair()`       | returns `std::pair<size_t,std::wstring>(accept(),wstr())`
  `size()`        | returns the length of the text match in bytes
  `wsize()`       | returns the length of the match in number of wide characters
  `lines()`       | returns the number of lines in the text match (>=1)
  `columns()`     | returns the number of columns of the text match (>=0)
  `begin()`       | returns `const char*` to non-0-terminated text match begin
  `end()`         | returns `const char*` to non-0-terminated text match end
  `rest()`        | returns `const char*` to 0-terminated rest of input
  `span()`        | returns `const char*` to 0-terminated match enlarged to span the line
  `line()`        | returns `std::string` line with the matched text as a substring
  `wline()`       | returns `std::wstring` line with the matched text as a substring
  `more()`        | tells the matcher to append the next match (when using `scan()`)
  `less(n)`       | cuts `text()` to `n` bytes and repositions the matcher
  `lineno()`      | returns line number of the match, starting at line 1
  `columno()`     | returns column number of the match, starting at 0
  `lineno_end()`  | returns ending line number of the match, starting at line 1
  `columno_end()` | returns ending column number of the match, starting at 0
  `bol()`         | returns `const char*` to non-0-terminated begin of matching line
  `border()`      | returns byte offset from the start of the line of the match
  `first()`       | returns input position of the first character of the match
  `last()`        | returns input position + 1 of the last character of the match
  `at_bol()`      | true if matcher reached the begin of a new line
  `at_bob()`      | true if matcher is at the begin of input and no input consumed
  `at_end()`      | true if matcher is at the end of input
  `[0]`           | operator returns `std::pair<const char*,size_t>(begin(),size())`
  `[n]`           | operator returns n'th capture `std::pair<const char*,size_t>`

The `accept()` method returns nonzero for a succesful match, returning the
group capture index.  The RE/flex matcher engine `reflex::Matcher` only
recognizes group captures at the top level of the regex (i.e. among the
top-level alternations), because it uses an efficient FSM for matching.

The `text()`, `strview()`, `str()`, and `wstr()` methods return the matched
text.  To get the first character of a match, use `chr()` or `wchr()`.  The
`chr()` and `wchr()` methods are much more efficient than `str()[0]` (or
`text()[0]`) and `wstr()[0]`, respectively.  Normally, a match cannot be empty
unless option `"N"` is specified to explicitly initialize a matcher, see
\ref regex-matcher, \ref regex-pcre2, and \ref regex-boost.

The `begin()`, `operator[0]`, and `operator[n]` return non-0-terminated
strings.  You must use `end()` with `begin()` to determine the span of the
match.  Basically, `text()` is the 0-terminated version of the string spanned
by `begin()` to `end()`, where `end()` points the next character after the
match, which means that `end()` = `begin()` + `size()`.  Use the size of the
capture returned by `operator[n]` to determine the end of the captured match.

The `lineno()` method returns the line number of the match, starting at line 1.
The ending line number is `lineno_end()`, which is identical to the value of
`lineno()` + `lines()` - 1.  

The `columno()` method returns the column offset of a match from the start of
the line, beginning at column 0.  This method takes tab spacing and wide
characters into account.  The inclusive ending column number is given by
`columno_end()`, which is equal or larger than `columno()` if the match does
not span multiple lines.  Otherwise, if the match spans multiple lines,
`columno_end()` is the ending column of the match on the last matching line.

The starting byte offset of the match on a line is `border()` and the ending
byte offset of the match is `border() + size() - 1`.

The `lines()` and `columns()` methods return the number of lines and columns
matched, where `columns()` takes tab spacing and wide characters into account.
If the match spans multiple lines, `columns()` counts columns over all lines,
without counting the newline characters.

@note A wide character is counted as one, thus `columno()`, `columno_end()`,
and `columns()` do not take the character width of full-width and combining
Unicode characters into account.  It is recommended to use the `wcwidth`
function or
[wcwidth.c](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c) to determine Unicode
character widths.

The `rest()` method returns the rest of the input character sequence as a
0-terminated `char*` string.  This method buffers all remaining input to return
the string.

The `span()` method enlarges the text matched to span the entire line and
returns the matching line as a 0-terminated `char*` string without the `\n`.

The `line()` and `wline()` methods return the entire line as a (wide) string
with the matched text as a substring.  These methods can be used to obtain the
context of a match.

@warning The methods `span()`, `line()`, and `wline()` invalidate the previous
`text()`, `strview()`, `begin()`, `bol()`, and `end()` string pointers.  Call
these methods again to retrieve the updated pointer or call `str()` or `wstr()`
to obtain a string copy of the match:
~~~{.cpp}
    // INCORRECT, because t is invalid after line():
    const char *t = text();
    std::string s = line();
    std::cout << t << " in " << s << std::endl;
    // OK with line():
    std::string s = line();
    const char *t = text();
    std::cout << t << " in " << s << std::endl;
    // OK with span():
    std::string t = str();
    const char *s = span();
    std::cout << t << " in " << s << std::endl;
~~~
The start of a line is truncated when the line is too long, longer than 256K
which is the initial buffer size `reflex::AbstractMatcher::Const::BUFSZ`.  When
this length is exceeded, the line's length before the match is truncated.  This
ensures that pattern matching binary files or files with very long lines cannot
cause memory allocation exceptions.

The `matcher().more()` method is used to create longer matches by stringing
together consecutive matches in the input after scanning the input with the
`scan()` method.  When this method is invoked, the next match with `scan()` has
its matched text prepended to it.  The `matcher().more()` operation is often
used in lexers and was introduced in Lex.

The `less(n)` method reduces the size of the matched text to `n` bytes.
This method has no effect if `n` is larger than `size()`.  The value of `n`
should not be `0`.  The `less(n)` operation is often used in lexers and was
introduced in Lex.

The `first()` and `last()` methods return the position in the input stream
of the match, counting in bytes from the start of the input at position 0.
If the input stream is a wide character sequence, the UTF-8 positions are
returned as a result of the internally-converted UTF-8 wide character input.

All methods take constant time to execute except for `str()`, `wstr()`,
`pair()`, `wpair()`, `wsize()`, `lines()`, `columns()`, and `columno()` that
require an extra pass over the matched text.

In addition, the following type casts of matcher objects and iterators may be
used for convenience:

- Casting to `size_t` gives the matcher's `accept()` index.
- Casting to `std::string` is the same as invoking `str()`
- Casting to `std::wstring` is the same as invoking `wstr()`.
- Casting to `std::pair<size_t,std::string>` is the same as `pair()`.
- Casting to `std::pair<size_t,std::wstring>` is the same as `wpair()`.

The following example prints some of the properties of each match:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h> // reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex

    reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout <<
        "accept: " << matcher.accept() <<
        "text:   " << matcher.text() <<
        "size:   " << matcher.size() <<
        "line:   " << matcher.lineno() <<
        "column: " << matcher.columno() <<
        "first:  " << matcher.first() <<
        "last:   " << matcher.last() << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    accept: 1 text: How size: 3 line: 1 column: 0 first: 0 last: 3
    accept: 1 text: now size: 3 line: 1 column: 4 first: 4 last: 7
    accept: 1 text: brown size: 5 line: 1 column: 8 first: 8 last: 13
    accept: 1 text: cow size: 3 line: 1 column: 14 first: 14 last: 17

### Public data members                                        {#regex-members}

Four public data members of a matcher object are accesible:

  Variable | Usage
  -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------
  `in`     | the `reflex::Input` object used by the matcher
  `find`   | the `reflex::AbstractMatcher::Operation` functor for searching
  `scan`   | the `reflex::AbstractMatcher::Operation` functor for scanning
  `split`  | the `reflex::AbstractMatcher::Operation` functor for splitting

Normally only the `in` variable should be used which holds the current input
object of the matcher.  See \ref regex-input for details.

The functors provide `begin()` and `end()` methods that return iterators and
hold the necessary state information for the iterators.  A functor invocation
essentially invokes the corresponding method listed in \ref regex-methods.

### Pattern methods                                    {#regex-methods-pattern}

To change a matcher's pattern or check if a pattern was assigned, you can use
the following methods:

  Method          | Result
  --------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------
  `pattern(p)`    | set pattern to `p` (string regex or `reflex::Pattern`)
  `has_pattern()` | true if the matcher has a pattern assigned to it
  `own_pattern()` | true if the matcher has a pattern to manage and delete
  `pattern()`     | get the pattern object associated with the matcher

The first method returns a reference to the matcher, so multiple method
invocations may be chained together.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Input methods                                        {#regex-methods-input}

To assign a new input source to a matcher or set the input to buffered or
interactive, you can use the following methods:

  Method          | Result
  --------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------
  `input(i)`      | set input to `reflex::Input i` (string, stream, or `FILE*`)
  `buffer()`      | buffer all input at once, returns true if successful
  `buffer(n)`     | set the adaptive buffer size to `n` bytes to buffer input
  `buffer(b, n)`  | use buffer of `n` bytes at address `b` with to a string of `n`-1 bytes (zero copy)
  `interactive()` | sets buffer size to 1 for console-based (TTY) input
  `flush()`       | flush the remaining input from the internal buffer
  `reset()`       | resets the matcher, restarting it from the remaining input
  `reset(o)`      | resets the matcher with new options string `o` ("A?N?T?")

The first method returns a reference to the matcher, so multiple method
invocations may be chained together.

The following methods may be used to read the input stream provided to a
matcher directly, even when you use the matcher's search and match methods:

  Method     | Result
  ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------
  `input()`  | returns next 8-bit char from the input, matcher then skips it
  `winput()` | returns next wide character from the input, matcher skips it
  `unput(c)` | put 8-bit char `c` back unto the stream, matcher then takes it
  `wunput(c)`| put (wide) char `c` back unto the stream, matcher then takes it
  `peek()`   | returns next 8-bit char from the input without consuming it
  `skip(c)`  | skip input until character `c` (`char` or `wchar_t`) is consumed
  `skip(s)`  | skip input until UTF-8 string `s` is consumed
  `rest()`   | returns the remaining input as a non-NULL `char*` string

The `input()`, `winput()`, and `peek()` methods return a non-negative character
code and EOF (-1) when the end of input is reached.

A matcher reads from the specified input source using its virtual method
`size_t get(char *s, size_t n)`.  This method is the same as invoking
`matcher().in.get(s, n)` to directly read data from the `reflex::Input` source
`in`, but also handles interactive input when enabled with
`matcher().interactive()` to not read beyond the next newline character.  

The following protected methods may be overriden by a derived matcher class to
customize reading:

  Method      | Result
  ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `get(s, n)` | fill `s[0..n-1]` with next input, returns number of bytes read
  `wrap()`    | returns false (may be overriden to wrap input after EOF)

When a matcher reaches the end of input, it invokes the virtual method `wrap()`
to check if more input is available.  This method returns false by default, but
this behavior may be changed by overriding `wrap()` to set a new input source
and return `true`, for example:

~~~{.cpp}
    class WrappedInputMatcher : public reflex::Matcher {
     public:
      WrappedInputMatcher() : reflex::Matcher(), source_select(0)
      { }
     private:
      virtual bool wrap()
      {
        // read a string, a file, and a string:
        switch (source_select++)
        {
          case 0: in = "Hello World!";
                  return true;
          case 1: in = fopen("hello.txt", "r");
                  return in.file() != NULL;
          case 2: fclose(in.file());
                  in = "Goodbye!";
                  return true;
        }
        return false;
      }
      int source_select;
    };
~~~

Note that the constructor in this example does not specify a pattern and input.
To set a pattern for the matcher after its instantiation use the `pattern(p)`
method.  In this case the input does not need to be specified, which allows us
to immediately force reading the sources of input that we assigned in our
`wrap()` method.

For details of the `reflex::Input` class, see \ref regex-input.

The Input class                                                  {#regex-input}
---------------

A matcher may accept several types of input, but can only read from one input
source at a time.  Input to a matcher is represented by a single
`reflex::Input` class instance that the matcher uses internally.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Assigning input                                       {#regex-input-assign}

An input object is constructed by specifying a string, a file, or a stream to
read from.  You can also reassign input to read from new input.

More specifically, you can pass a `std::string`, `char*`, `std::wstring`,
`wchar_t*`, `FILE*`, or a `std::istream` to the constructor.

A `FILE*` file descriptor is a special case.  The input object handles various
file encodings.  If a UTF Byte Order Mark (BOM) is detected then the UTF input
will be normalized to UTF-8.  When no UTF BOM is detected then the input is
considered plain ASCII, binary, or UTF-8 and passed through unconverted.  To
override the file encoding when no UTF BOM was present, and normalize Latin-1,
ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-15, CP 1250 through 1258, CP 437, CP 850, CP 858,
KOI8, MACROMAN, EBCDIC, and other encodings to UTF-8, see \ref regex-input-file.

### Input strings                                        {#regex-input-strings}

An input object constructed from an 8-bit string `char*` or `std::string` just
passes the string to the matcher engine.  The string should contain UTF-8 when
Unicode patterns are used.

An input object constructed from a wide string `wchar_t*` or `std::wstring`
translates the wide string to UTF-8 for matching, which effectively normalizes
the input for matching with Unicode patterns.  This conversion is illustrated
below.  The copyright symbol `¬©` with Unicode U+00A9 is matched against its
UTF-8 sequence `C2 A9` of `¬©`:

~~~{.cpp}
    if (reflex::Matcher("¬©", L"¬©").matches())
      std::cout << "copyright symbol matches\n";
~~~

To ensure that Unicode patterns in UTF-8 strings are grouped properly, use
\ref regex-convert, for example as follows:

~~~{.cpp}
    static reflex::Pattern CR(reflex::Matcher::convert("(?u:\u{00A9})"));
    if (reflex::Matcher(CR, L"¬©").matches())
      std::cout << "copyright symbol matches\n";
~~~

Here we made the converted pattern static to avoid repeated conversion and
construction overheads.

@note The `char*`, `wchar_t*`, and `std::wstring` strings cannot contain a `\0`
(NUL) character and the first `\0` terminates matching.  To match strings
and binary input that contain `\0`, use `std::string` or `std::istringstream`.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Input streams                                        {#regex-input-streams}

An input object constructed from a `std::istream` (or a derived class) just
passes the input text to the matcher engine.  The stream should contain ASCII
and may contain UTF-8.

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### FILE encodings                                          {#regex-input-file}

File content specified with a `FILE*` file descriptor can be encoded in ASCII,
binary, UTF-8/16/32, ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-15, CP 1250 through 1258, CP
437, CP 850, CP 858, or EBCDIC.

A [UTF Byte Order Mark (BOM)](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html) is
detected in the content of a file scanned by the matcher, which enables UTF-8
normalization of the input automatically.

Otherwise, if no file encoding is explicitly specified, the matcher expects
raw UTF-8, ASCII, or plain binary by default.  File formats can be decoded and
translated to UTF-8 on the fly for matching by means of specifying encodings.

The current file encoding used by a matcher is obtained with the
`reflex::Input::file_encoding()` method, which returns an
`reflex::Input::file_encoding` constant of type
`reflex::Input::file_encoding_type`:

  Constant                                   | File encoding
  ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::plain`      | plain octets, ASCII/binary/UTF-8
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::utf8`       | UTF-8 (UTF BOM detected)
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::utf16be`    | UTF-16 big endian (UTF BOM detected)
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::utf16le`    | UTF-16 little endian (UTF BOM detected)
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::utf32be`    | UTF-32 big endian (UTF BOM detected)
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::utf32le`    | UTF-32 little endian (UTF BOM detected)
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::latin`      | ASCII with Latin-1, ISO-8859-1
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::cp437`      | DOS CP 437
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::cp850`      | DOS CP 850
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::cp858`      | DOS CP 858

  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::iso8859_15` | ISO-8859-15
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::iso8859_16` | ISO-8859-16
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::macroman`   | Macintosh Roman + CR to LF translation
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::koi8_r`     | KOI8-R
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::koi8_u`     | KOI8-U
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::koi8_ru`    | KOI8-RU
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::null_data`  | convert between NUL <-> LF
  `reflex::Input::file_encoding::custom`     | user-defined custom code page

The `null_data` encoding type converts between NUL (zere byte) and LF (`\n`)
to support input from tools that output NUL for newlines, such as `xargs -0`.

To specify a file encoding when assigning a file to be read, use
`reflex::Input(file, enc)` with `enc` one of the encoding constants shown in
the table above.

For example, `reflex::Input::file_encoding::latin` supports files with
ISO-8859-1 content.  This way you can match its content using Unicode patterns,
since the RE/flex matcher engines internally normalize the specified encodings
to UTF-8 for pattern matching:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Input input(stdin, reflex::Input::file_encoding::latin);
    reflex::Matcher matcher(pattern, input);
~~~

This sets the input encoding to ISO-8859-1, but only if no UTF BOM was detected
on the standard input we are reading from.  The encoding of an input file
specified as a `FILE*` argument when the file has a UTF BOM cannot be changed.
The input of UTF-encoded files is normalized to UTF-8 when read.

To define a custom code page to normalize the input to Unicode, define a code
page table with 256 entries that maps each 8-bit input character to a 16-bit
Unicode character (UCS-2).  Then use `reflex::Input::file_encoding::custom`
with a pointer to your code page to construct an input object.  For example:

~~~{.cpp}
    static const unsigned short CP[256] = {
       32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,
       32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,
       32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47,
       48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63,
       64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79,

       32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,

       32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,

       32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,
       32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,
       32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,

    };
    reflex::Input input(stdin, reflex::Input::file_encoding::custom, CP);
    reflex::Matcher matcher(pattern, input);
~~~

This example translates all control characters and characters above 127 to
spaces before matching.

### Input properties                                  {#regex-input-properties}

To obtain the properties of an input source use the following methods:

  Method      | Result
  ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
  `size()`    | size in bytes of the remaining input, zero when EOF or unknown
  `good()`    | input is available to read (no error and not EOF)
  `eof()`     | end of input (but use only `at_end()` with matchers!)
  `cstring()` | the current `const char*` (of a `std::string`) or NULL
  `wstring()` | the current `const wchar_t*` (of a `std::wstring`) or NULL
  `file()`    | the current `FILE*` file descriptor or NULL
  `istream()` | a `std::istream*` pointer to the current stream object or NULL

üîù [Back to table of contents](#)

### Input streambuf                                    {#regex-input-streambuf}

We can use a `reflex::Input` object as a `std::streambuf` and pass it to a
`std::istream`.  This is useful when a `std::istream` is required where a
`reflex::Input` object cannot be directly used.  The `std::istream`
automatically normalizes the input to UTF-8 using the underlying
`reflex::Input` object.  For example:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Input input(...);            // create an Input object for some given input
    reflex::Input::streambuf buf(input); // create a streambuf
    std::istream is(&buf);
    if (is.good())
    {
      // read the stream
    }
~~~

The `reflex::Input` object may be created from strings, wide strings, streams,
and `FILE*` values.  These are readable as a `std::istream` via
`reflex::Input::streambuf` that returns normalized UTF-8 characters.  For
`FILE*` values we can specify \ref regex-input-file to normalize the encoded
input to UTF-8.

Keep in mind that adding a `std::istream` with `reflex::Input::streambuf` layer
on top of the efficient `reflex::Input` class will impact file reading
performance, especially because `reflex::Input::streambuf` is unbuffered
(despite its name).  When performance is important, use the buffered version
`reflex::BufferedInput::streambuf`:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Input input(...);                    // create an Input object for some given input
    reflex::BufferedInput::streambuf buf(input); // create a buffered streambuf
    std::istream is(&buf);
    if (is.good())
    {
      // read the stream
    }
~~~

Because the buffered vesion reads ahead to fill its buffer, the buffered
version may not be suitable for interactive input.

### Windows CRLF pairs                              {#regex-input-dosstreambuf}

Reading files in Windows "binary mode" is recommended when the file is encoded
in UTF-16 or UTF-32.  Reading a file in the default "text mode" replaces CRLF
by LF and interprets ^Z (0x1A) as EOF.  Because a ^Z code may be part of a
UTF-16 or UTF-32 multibyte sequence, this can cause premature EOF on Windows
machines.  The latest RE/flex releases automatically switch `FILE*` input to
binary mode on Windows systems when the file is encoded in UTF-16 or UTF-32.

In addition, DOS files and other DOS or Windows input sources typically end
lines with CRLF byte pairs, see \ref crlf.  Reading a file in binary mode
retains these CRLF pairs.

To automatically replace CRLF by LF when reading files in binary mode on
Windows you can use the `reflex::Input::dos_streambuf` class to construct a
`std::istream` object.  This normalized stream can then be used as input to a
RE/flex scanner or to a regex matcher:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Input input(...);                // create an Input object for some given input
    reflex::Input::dos_streambuf buf(input); // create a dos_streambuf
    std::istream is(&buf);
    if (is.good())
    {
      // read the stream
    }
~~~

Once the stream object is created it can be used to create a new input object
for a RE/flex scanner, for example:

~~~{.cpp}
    if (is.good())
    {
      Lexer lexer(is); // create a lexer
      lexer.lex();     // scan the normalized input (DOS CRLF -> LF)
    }
~~~

or for a regex matcher that uses PCRE2 or Boost.Regex:

~~~{.cpp}
    if (is.good())
    {
      reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", is); // read normalized input (DOS CRLF -> LF)
      while (matcher.find() != 0)
        std::cout << "Found " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
    }
~~~

Note that when the input is a `FILE*`, CRLF pairs are replaced by LF and
UTF-16/32 encodings are automatically normalized to UTF-8 (when a UTF BOM is
present in the file or you can specify \ref regex-input-file).

@warning The `reflex::Input::size` method returns the number of bytes available
that includes CRLF pairs.  The actual number of bytes read may be smaller after
replacing CRLF by LF.

When performance is important, use the buffered version
`reflex::BufferedInput::dos_streambuf`:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Input input(...);                        // create an Input object for some given input
    reflex::BufferedInput::dos_streambuf buf(input); // create a buffered dos_streambuf
    std::istream is(&buf);
    if (is.good())
    {
      // read the stream
    }
~~~

Because the buffered vesion reads ahead to fill its buffer, the buffered
version may not be suitable for interactive input:

This section includes several examples to demonstrate the concepts discussed.

### Example 1

This example illustrates the `find` and `split` methods and iterators with a
RE/flex `reflex::Matcher` and a `reflex::BoostMatcher` using a C++11
range-based loop:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h>
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>

    using namespace reflex;

    // some random text (with extra spacing)
    std::string example("Monty\n Python's    Flying  Circus");

    // construct a fixed pattern that is case insensitive
    static Pattern pattern("monty|python", "i");

    // construct a matcher to search the example text
    Matcher matcher(pattern, example);
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << matcher.text()
                << " at " << matcher.lineno() << "," << matcher.columno()
                << " spans " << matcher.first() << ".." << matcher.last()
                << std::endl;

    // construct a Boost.Regex matcher to count the words (all non-spaces "\S+")
    BoostMatcher boostmatcher("\\S+", example);
    boostmatcher.buffer(); // because Boost.Regex partial_match is broken!
    std::cout << std::distance(boostmatcher.find.begin(), boostmatcher.find.end())
              << " words"
              << std::endl;

    // reuse the BoostMatcher with a C++11 range-based loop to split the example text on space "\s+":
    for (auto& split : boostmatcher.pattern("\\s+").input(example).split)
      std::cout << split.text() << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // reuse the BoostMatcher to split on whitespace using an iterator, sort into a set, and print
    boostmatcher.input(example).buffer();
    std::set<std::string> words(boostmatcher.split.begin(), boostmatcher.split.end());
    std::copy(words.begin(), words.end(), std::ostream_iterator<std::string>(std::cout, " "));
    std::cout << std::endl;
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    Monty at 1,0 spans 0..5
    Python at 2,1 spans 7..13
    4 words
    Monty Python's Flying Circus
    Circus Flying Monty Python's

### Example 2

This example shows how a URL can be matched by using two patterns: one pattern
to extract the host:port/path parts and another pattern to extract the query
string key-value pairs in a loop.  A PCRE2 matcher or a Boost.Regex matcher may
be used, since both support group captures.

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>
    #include <iostream>

    using namespace reflex;

    const char *URL = "...";

    // match URL host:port/path using group captures for these
    BoostMatcher re("https?://([^:/]*):?(\\d*)/?([^?#]*)", URL);

    if (re.scan())

### Example 3

This example shows how input can be reassigned in each iteration of a loop that
matches wide strings against a word pattern `\w+`:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h>

    using namespace reflex;

    // four words
    const wchar_t *words[] = { L"Monty", L"Python's", L"Flying", L"Circus" };

    // construct a PCRE2 matcher for words, given empty input initially
    PCRE2Matcher wordmatcher("\\w+", Input());

    // check if each string in words[] is a word
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
      if (wordmatcher.input(words[i]).matches())
        std::cout << wordmatcher.text() << ", ";
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    Monty, Flying, Circus,

### Example 4

This example counts the number of words, lines, and chars from the `std::cin`
stream:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/stdmatcher.h>

    using namespace reflex;

    // construct a std::regex matcher like the wc command (a word is a series of nonspaces)
    StdMatcher word("\\S+", std::cin);

    size_t words = std::distance(word.find.begin(), word.find.end());
    size_t lines = word.lineno() - 1;
    size_t chars = word.last();

    std::cout << lines << " " << words << " " << chars << std::endl;

### Example 5

This example tokenizes a string by grouping the subpatterns in a regex and by
using the group index of the capture obtained with `accept()` in a C++11
range-based loop:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/matcher.h>

    using namespace reflex;

    static Pattern pattern =
      "(\\w*cat\\w*)|" // 1st group = token 1
      "(\\w*dog\\w*)|" // 2nd group = token 2
      "(\\w+)|"        // 3rd group = token 3
      "(.)";           // 4th group = token 4

    Matcher tokenizer(pattern, "cats love hotdogs!");

    for (auto& token : tokenizer.scan)
      std::cout << "Token = " << token.accept()
                << ": matched '" << token.text() << "'"
                << " with '" << token.pattern()[token.accept()] << "'\n";
    assert(tokenizer.at_end());
~~~

When executed this code prints:

    Token = 1: matched 'cats' with '(\\w*cat\\w*)'
    Token = 4: matched ' ' with '(.)'
    Token = 3: matched 'love' with '(\\w+)'
    Token = 4: matched ' ' with '(.)'
    Token = 2: matched 'hotdogs' with '(\\w*dog\\w*)'
    Token = 4: matched '!' with '(.)'

This example reads a file with embedded credit card numbers to extract.  The
numbers are sorted into five sets for each type of major credit card:

    static Pattern card_patterns =
      "(?# MasterCard)(5[1-5]\\d{14})|"                   // 1st group = MC
      "(?# Visa)(4\\d{12}(?:\\d{3})?)|"                   // 2nd group = VISA
      "(?# AMEX)(3[47]\\d{13})|"                          // 3rd group = AMEX
      "(?# Discover)(6011\\d{14})|"                       // 4th group = Discover
      "(?# Diners Club)((?:30[0-5]|36\\d|38\\d)\\d{11})"; // 5th group = Diners

    static const char *card_data =
      "mark 5212345678901234\n"

      "dirk 601112345678901234\n"
      "doc 38812345678901 end\n";

    std::set<std::string> cards[5];

    Matcher matcher(card_patterns, card_data);
    for (Matcher::iterator match = matcher.find.begin(); match != matcher.find.end(); ++match)
      cards[match.accept() - 1].insert(match.text());

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
      for (std::set<std::string>::const_iterator j = cards[i].begin(); j != cards[i].end(); ++j)
        std::cout << i << ": " << *j << std::endl;

### Example 7

The RE/flex matcher engine `reflex::Matcher` only recognizes group captures at
the top level of the regex (i.e. among the top-level alternations), because it
uses an efficient FSM for matching.

By contrast, the PCRE2 matcher can capture groups within a regex:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/pcre2matcher.h>

    // a PCRE2Matcher to find 'TODO' lines on stdin and capture their content to display
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("TODO ([^\\n]+)", stdin);
    while (matcher.find())
      std::cout
        << matcher.lineno() << ": "
        << std::string(matcher[1].first, matcher[1].second)
        << std::endl;
~~~

The PCRE2 and Boost.Regex libraries also support group captures and partial
matches, but that feature appears to be broken with Boost.Regex, so all input
must be buffered when Boost.Regex is used:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>

    // a BoostMatcher to find 'TODO' lines on stdin and capture their content to display
    reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("TODO ([^\\n]+)", stdin);
    matcher.buffer(); // because Boost.Regex partial_match is broken!
    while (matcher.find())
      std::cout
        << matcher.lineno() << ": "
        << std::string(matcher[1].first, matcher[1].second)
        << std::endl;
~~~

### Example 8

This is a more advanced example, in which we will use the
`reflex::BoostMatcher` class to decompose URLs into parts: the host, port,
path, optional ?-query string key=value pairs, and an optional #-anchor.

To do so, we change the pattern of the matcher to partially match each of the
URL's parts and also use `input()` to check the input character:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>
    #include <iostream>

    using namespace reflex;

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
      if (argc < 2)
      {
        std::cerr << "Usage: url 'URL'" << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
      }

      BoostMatcher re("https?://([^:/]*):?(\\d*)/?([^?#]*)", argv[1]);

      if (re.scan())
      {
        // found a partial match at start, now check if we have a host
        if (re[1].first != NULL)
        {
          std::string host(re[1].first, re[1].second);
          std::cout << "host: " << host << std::endl;

          // check of we have a port
          if (re[2].first != NULL && re[2].second != 0)
          {
            std::string port(re[2].first, re[2].second);
            std::cout << "port: " << port << std::endl;
          }

          // check of we have a path
          if (re[3].first != NULL && re[3].second != 0)
          {
            std::string path(re[3].first, re[3].second);
            std::cout << "path: " << path << std::endl;
          }
        }

        // check if we have a query string
        if (re.input() == '?')
        {
          // now switch patterns to match the rest of the input
          // i.e. a query string or an anchor
    #if 0
          // 1st method: a pattern to split query strings at '&'
          re.pattern("&");
          while (re.split())
            std::cout << "query: " << re << std::endl;
    #else
          // 2nd method: a pattern to capture key-value pairs between the '&'
          re.pattern("([^=&]*)=?([^&]*)&?");
          while (re.scan())
            std::cout <<
              "query key: " << std::string(re[1].first, re[1].second) <<
              ", value: " << std::string(re[2].first, re[2].second) << std::endl;
    #endif
        }
        else if (!re.at_end())
        {
          // not a query string and not the end, we expect an # anchor
          std::cout << "anchor: " << re.rest() << std::endl;
        }
      }
      else
      {
        std::cout << "Error, not a http/s URL: " << re.rest() << std::endl;
      }

      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
~~~

Note that there are two ways to split the query string into key-value pairs.
Both methods are shown in the two `#if` branches in the code above, with the
first branch disabled with `#if 0`.

When executing

    ./url 'https://localhost:8080/test/me?name=reflex&license=BSD-3'

this code prints:

    host: localhost
    port: 8080
    path: test/me
    query key: name, value: reflex
    query key: license, value: BSD-3

### Example 9

This example shows how a `FILE*` file descriptor is used as input.  The file
encoding is obtained from the UTF BOM, when present in the file.  Note that the
file's state is accessed through the matcher's member variable `in`:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/boostmatcher.h>

    using namespace reflex;

    BoostMatcher matcher("\\s+", fopen("filename", "r"));

    if (matcher.in.file() != NULL && matcher.in.good())
    {
      switch (matcher.in.file_encoding())
      {

        case Input::file_encoding::koi8_ru:    std::cout << "KOI8-RU";                  break;
      }
      std::cout << " of " << matcher.in.size() << " converted bytes to read\n";

        std::cout << "Starts with: " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
      std::cout << "Rest of the file is: " << matcher.rest();
      fclose(matcher.in.file());
    }
~~~

The default encoding is `reflex::Input::file_encoding::plain` when no UTF BOM
is detected at the start of the input file.  The encodings
`reflex::Input::file_encoding::latin`, `reflex::Input::file_encoding::cp1252`,
`reflex::Input::file_encoding::cp437`, `reflex::Input::file_encoding::cp850`,
`reflex::Input::file_encoding::ebcdic` are never detected automatically,
because plain encoding is implicitly assumed to be the default encoding.  To
convert these files, set the file encoding format explicitly in your code.  For
example, if you expect the source file to contain ISO-8859-1 8-bit characters
(ASCII and the latin-1 supplement) then set the default file encoding to
`reflex::Input::file_encoding::latin` as follows:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Input input(fopen("filename", "r"), reflex::Input::file_encoding::latin);
    if (input.file() != NULL)
    {
      reflex::BoostMatcher matcher("\\s+", input);
      matcher.buffer(); // because Boost.Regex partial_match is broken!
      if (matcher.split() != 0)
        std::cout << "Starts with: " << matcher.text() << std::endl;
      std::cout << "Rest of the file is: " << matcher.rest();
      fclose(input.file());
    }
~~~

This sets the file encoding to ISO-8859-1, but only if no UTF BOM was detected
in the file.  Files with a UTF BOM are always decoded as UTF, which cannot be
overruled.

Errors when declaring extern yyin, yytext, yylineno              {#extern-yyin}
---------------------------------------------------

For backward compatibility with Flex, option `‚àí‚àíflex` defines macros to expand
`yyin`, `yyout`, `yylineno`, `yytext`, and `yyleng`.  The macro expansion
depends on the `‚àí‚àíbison` option or `‚àí‚àíbison-locations`, `‚àí‚àíbison-cc` and so on.

When used with `‚àí‚àíflex`, option `‚àí‚àíbison` generates global "yy" variables and
functions, see \ref reflex-bison-mt-safe for details.  This means that
`yytext`, `yyleng`, and `yylineno` are global variables.  More specifically,
the following declarations are generated with `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison`:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    char *yytext;
    yy_size_t yyleng;
    int yylineno;
    int yylex();
~~~
</div>

Note that `yyin` is not a global variable, because the `yyin` macro expands to
a pointer to the `reflex::Input` of the matcher.  This offers advanced input
handling capabilities with `reflex::Input` that is more useful compared to the
traditional global `FILE *yyin` variable.

However, the following declaration, when present in a Lex/Flex lexer
specification, may cause a compilation error:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    extern FILE *yyin; // ERROR: fails to compile (remove this line)
~~~
</div>

Option `‚àí‚àíyy` enables `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison`.  In addition, this option
generates the following declarations to define the `yyin` and `yyout` as
global `FILE*` type variables:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    FILE *yyin;
    FILE *yyout;
~~~
</div>

Note that without option `‚àí‚àíyy`, when options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíbison` are used,
`yyin` is a pointer to a `reflex::Input` object.  This means that `yyin` is not
restricted to `FILE*` types and accepts files, steams and strings:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    std::ifstream ifs(filename, std::ios::in);
    yyin = &ifs; // FILE* or std::istream
~~~
</div>

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    yyin = "..."; // (wide) strings
~~~
</div>

See \ref reflex-input.

Compilation errors when using yy functions                      {#yy-functions}
------------------------------------------

To use Flex' `yy` functions in your scanner's actions, use option `‚àí‚àíflex` for
Flex compatibility (see also previous section).

In addition, note that by default the <b>`reflex`</b> command generates a
reentrant C++ scanner class, unless option `‚àí‚àíbison` is used.  This means that
by default all `yy` functions are scanner class methods, not global functions.
This obviously means that `yy` functions cannot be globally invoked, e.g. from
your parser.  These are the alternatives:

- Generate global `yy` functions like Flex with option `‚àí‚àíyy` (or `‚àí‚àíflex` and
  `‚àí‚àíbison`).  This approach is not thread safe.
- Generate thread-safe C++ scanner class (by default) and pass the scanner
  object to your parser to invoke the scanner's methods.  Note that scanner
  methods are not `yy` functions, see the list of scanner methods listed in 
  \ref reflex-spec-rules.
- Generate a thread-safe C++ scanner class and let the parser class inherit the
  scanner class.  All scanner methods are available in the parser too.
- Generate a thread-safe C++ scanner class but also `#define YY_SCANNER`
  (redefine) in your parser and in other parts of the program that need to
  invoke `yy` functions:
<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    #include "lexer.hpp"  // generated with --header-file=lexer.hpp
    ...
    #undef YY_SCANNER
    #define YY_SCANNER lexer
    int parser(Lexer& lexer, ...) {
      ...
      int c = yyinput();  // is lexer.input() which is lexer.matcher().input()
      ...
    }
~~~
</div>
Note that the `yyinput()` macro expands to `YY_SCANNER.input()`, where
`YY_SCANNER` is normally `(*this)`, i.e. the current scanner object, or
`YY_SCANNER` is the global scanner object/state when option `‚àí‚àíbison` is used
to generate global `yy` variables and functions stored in the global
`YY_SCANNER` object.

Invalid UTF encodings and the dot pattern                        {#invalid-utf}
-----------------------------------------

It may be tempting to write a pattern with `.` (dot) as a wildcard in a lexer
specification, but beware that in Unicode mode enabled with
<i>`%%option unicode`</i> or with modifier `(?u:œÜ)`, the dot matches any code
point, including code points outside of the valid Unicode character range and
invalid overlong UTF-8 (except that it won't match newline unless
<i>`%%option dotall`</i> is specified.)  The reason for this design choice is
that a lexer should be able to implement a "catch all else" rule to report
errors in the input:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    .    std::cerr << "lexical error, full stop!" << std::endl;
         return 0;
~~~
</div>

If dot in Unicode mode with <i>`%%option unicode`</i> would be restricted to
match valid Unicode only, then the action above will never be triggered when
invalid input is encountered.  Because all non-dot regex patterns are valid
Unicode in RE/flex, it would be impossible to write a "catch all else" rule
that catches input format errors!

The dot in Unicode mode is self-synchronizing and consumes text up to the next
ASCII or Unicode character.

Because the `.` is "permissive" by design with <i>`%%option unicode`</i>,
multiple `.` dots in sequence can match a single multi-byte Unicode character
by its individual bytes.

To accept only valid Unicode input in regex patterns, make sure to avoid `.`
(dot) and use `\p{Unicode}` or `\X` instead, and reserve dot to catch anything,
such as invalid UTF encodings.  We can use `.|\n` or <i>`%%option dotall`</i>
to catch anything including `\n` and invalid UTF-8/16/32 encodings.

Furthermore, before matching any input, invalid UTF-16 input is detected
automatically by the `reflex::Input` class and replaced with the
`::REFLEX_NONCHAR` code point U+200000 that lies outside the valid Unicode
range.  This code point is never matched by non-dot regex patterns and is easy
to detect by a regex pattern with a dot and a corresponding error action as
shown above.

Note that character classes written as bracket lists may produce invalid
Unicode ranges when used improperly.  This is not a problem for matching, but
may prevent rejecting surrogate halves that are invalid Unicode.  For example,
`[\u{00}-\u{10FFFF}]` obviously includes the invalid range of surrogate halves
`[\u{D800}-\u{DFFF}]`.  You can always remove surrogate halves from any
character class by intersecting the class with `[\p{Unicode}]`, that is
`[...&&[\p{Unicode}]]`.  Furthermore, character class negation with `^` results
in classes that are within range U+0000 to U+10FFFF and excludes surrogate
halves.

Error reporting and recovery                                          {#errors}
----------------------------

When your scanner or parser encounters an error in the input, the scanner or
parser should report it and attempt to continue processing the input by
recovering from the error condition.  Most compilers recover from an error to
continue processing the input until a threshold on the maximum number of errors
is exceeded.

In our lexer specification of a scanner, we may define a "catch all else" rule
with pattern `.` to report an unmatched "mystery character" that is not
recognized.  For example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %class{
      static const size_t max_errors = 10;
      size_t errors;
    }

    %init{
      errors = 0;
    }

    %%
    ...  // lexer rules

    .    std::string line = matcher().line();
         std::cerr << "Error: mystery character at line " << lineno() << ":\n" << line << std::endl;
         for (size_t i = columno(); i > 0; --i)
           std::cerr << " ";
         std::cerr << "\\__ here" << std::endl;
         if (++errors >= max_errors)
           return 0;
    %%
~~~
</div>

Beware that a `.` (dot) matches any character or byte, including invalid
Unicode.  See also \ref invalid-utf.

The error message indicates the offending line number with `lineno()` and
prints the problematic line of input using `matcher().line()`.  The position on
the line is indicated with an arrow placed below the line at offset `columno()`
from the start of the line, where `columno()` takes tabs and wide characters
into account.

This error message does not take the window width into account, which may
result in misplacing the arrow when the line is too long and overflows onto the
next rows in the window, unless changes are made to the code to print the
relevant part of the line only.

There are other ways to indicate the location of an error, for example as
`-->` `<--` and highlighting the error using the ANSI SGI escape sequence for
bold typeface:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    .    std::string line = lexer->matcher().line();
         std::string before = line.substr(0, border());
         std::string after = line.substr(border() + size());
         std::cerr << "Error: mystery character at line " << lineno() << ":" << std::endl;
         std::cerr << before << "\033[1m --> " << str() << " <-- \033[0m" << after << std::endl;
         if (++errors >= max_errors)
           return 0;
~~~
</div>

This prints the start of the line up to the mismatching position on the line
returned by `border()`, followed by the highlighted "mystery character".
Beware that this can be a control code or invalid Unicode code point, which
should be checked before displaying it.

This scanner terminates when 10 lexical errors are encountered in the input, as
defined by `max_errors`.

By default, Bison invokes `yyerror()` (or `yy::parser::error()` with
\ref reflex-bison-cc parsers) to report syntax errors.  However, it is
recommended to use Bison error productions to handle and resolve syntax errors
intelligently by synchronizing on tokens that allow the parser to continue, for
example on a semicolon in a \ref reflex-bison-bridge parser:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      #include "lex.yy.h"
      #define YYPARSE_PARAM lexer
      #define YYLEX_PARAM   lexer
      void yyerror(Lexer *lexer, const char *msg);
    %}

    %pure-parser
    %lex-param { Lexer *lexer }
    %parse-param { Lexer *lexer }

    %%
    ...          // grammar rules

    | error ';'  { yyerrok; if (++lexer->errors >= lexer->max_errors) YYABORT; }
    ;
    %%
~~~
</div>

@note `%%pure-parser` is deprecated and replaced with `%%define api.pure`.

We keep track of the number of errors by incrementing `lexer->errors`.  When
the maximum number of lexical and syntax errors is reached, we bail out.

The line of input where the syntax error occurs is reported with `yyerror()` for
the \ref reflex-bison-bridge parser:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    void yyerror(Lexer *lexer, const char *msg)
    {
      std::string line = lexer->matcher().line();
      std::string before = line.substr(0, border());
      std::string after = line.substr(border() + size());
      std::cerr << "Error: " << msg << " at line " << lexer->lineno() << ":" << std::endl;
      std::cerr << before << "\033[1m --> " << lexer->str() << " <-- \033[0m" << after << std::endl;
    }
~~~
</div>

With option `‚àí‚àíflex`, the definitions part of the lexer specification is
updated as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %{
      #include "lex.yy.h"
      void yyerror(yyscan_t, const char*);
      #define YYPARSE_PARAM scanner
      #define YYLEX_PARAM   scanner
    %}

    %option flex

    %pure-parser
    %lex-param { void *scanner }
    %parse-param { void *scanner }
~~~
</div>

And the `yyerror()` function is updated as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    void yyerror(yyscan_t scanner, const char *msg)
    {
      yyFlexLexer *lexer = static_cast<yyscanner_t*>(scanner);
      std::string line = lexer->matcher().line();
      std::string before = line.substr(0, border());
      std::string after = line.substr(border() + size());
      std::cerr << "Error: " << msg << " at line " << lexer->lineno() << ":" << std::endl;
      std::cerr << before << "\033[1m --> " << lexer->str() << " <-- \033[0m" << after << std::endl;
    }
~~~
</div>

@note `%%pure-parser` is deprecated and replaced with `%%define api.pure`.

These examples assume that the syntax error was detected immediately at the
last token scanned and displayed with `lexer->str()`, which may not always be
the case.

With \ref reflex-bison-bridge-locations parsers (and optionally `‚àí‚àíflex`),
we obtain the first and the last line of an error and we can use this
information to report the error.  For example as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    void yyerror(YYLTYPE *yylloc, yyscan_t scanner, const char *msg)
    {
      yyFlexLexer *lexer = static_cast<yyscanner_t*>(scanner);
      std::cerr << "Error: " << msg << " at line " << yylloc->first_line << ":" << std::endl;
      if (yylloc->first_line == yylloc->last_line && yylloc->first_line == lexer->lineno())
      {
        std::cerr << lexer->matcher().line() << std::endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < yylloc->first_column; ++i)
           std::cerr << " ";
        for (int i = yylloc->first_column; i <= yylloc->last_column; ++i)
           std::cerr << "~";
        std::cerr << std::endl;
      }
      else
      {
        FILE *file = lexer->in().file(); // the current FILE* being scanned
        if (file != NULL)
        {
          YY_BUFFER_STATE buf = yy_create_buffer(file, YY_BUF_SIZE, scanner);
          yypush_buffer_state(buf, scanner); // push current buffer (matcher), use buf
          off_t pos = ftell(file); // save current position in the file
          fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET); // go to the start of the file
          for (int i = 1; i < yylloc->first_line; ++i)
            buf->skip('\n'); // skip to the next line
          for (int i = yylloc->first_line; i <= yylloc->last_line; ++i)
          {
            std::cerr << buf->line() << std::endl; // display offending line
            buf->skip('\n'); // next line
          }
          fseek(file, pos, SEEK_SET); // restore position in the file to continue scanning
          yypop_buffer_state(scanner); // restore buffer (matcher)
        }
      }
    }
~~~
</div>

Because we use Flex-compatible reentrant functions `yy_create_buffer()`,
`yypush_buffer_state()`, and `yypop_buffer_state()` that take an extra scanner
argument, we also use options `‚àí‚àíflex` and `‚àí‚àíreentrant` in addition to
`‚àí‚àíbison-bridge` and `‚àí‚àíbison-locations` to generate the reentrant scanner for
the example shown above.

Similarly, with \ref reflex-bison-complete-locations parsers, syntax errors can
be reported as follows (without option `‚àí‚àíflex`):

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    void yy::parser::error(const location& loc, const std::string& msg)
    {
      std::cerr << loc << ": " << msg << std::endl;
      if (loc.begin.line == loc.end.line && loc.begin.line == lexer.lineno())
      {
        std::cerr << lexer.matcher().line() << std::endl;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < loc.begin.column; ++i)
          std::cerr << " ";
        for (size_t i = loc.begin.column; i <= loc.end.column; ++i)
          std::cerr << "~";
        std::cerr << std::endl;
      }
      else
      {
        FILE *file = lexer.in().file(); // the current file being scanned
        if (file != NULL)
        {
          yy::scanner::Matcher *m = lexer.new_matcher(file); // new matcher
          lexer.push_matcher(m); // save the current matcher
          off_t pos = ftell(file); // save current position in the file
          fseek(file, 0, SEEK_SET); // go to the start of the file
          for (size_t i = 1; i < loc.begin.line; ++i)
            m->skip('\n'); // skip to the next line
          for (size_t i = loc.begin.line; i <= loc.end.line; ++i)
          {
            std::cerr << m->line() << std::endl; // display offending line
            m->skip('\n'); // next line
          }
          fseek(file, pos, SEEK_SET); // restore position in the file to continue scanning
          lexer.pop_matcher(); // restore matcher
        }
      }
    }
~~~
</div>

If option `‚àí‚àíexception` is specified with a lexer specification, for example as
follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %option exception="yy::parser::error(location(), \"Unknown token.\")"
~~~
</div>

then we should make sure to consume some input in the exception handler to
advance the scanner forward to skip the offending input and to allow the
scanner to recover:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    void yy::parser::error(const location& loc, const std::string& msg)
    {
      if (lexer.size() == 0) // if token is unknown (no match)
          lexer.matcher().winput(); // skip character
      ...
    }
~~~
</div>

Error reporting can be combined with Bison Lookahead Correction (LAC), which is
enabled with:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %define parse.lac full
~~~
</div>

For more details on Bison error messaging, resolution, and LAC, please see the
Bison documentation.

On using setlocale                                                 {#setlocale}
------------------

The RE/flex scanners and regex matchers use an internal buffer with UTF-8
encoded text content to scan wide strings and UTF-16/UTF-32 input.  This means
that Unicode input is normalized to UTF-8 prior to matching.  This internal
conversion is independent of the current locale and is performed automatically
by the `reflex::Input` class that passes the UTF-8-normalized input to the
matchers.

Furthermore, RE/flex lexers may invoke the `wstr()`, `wchr()`, and `wpair()`
methods to extract wide string and wide character matches.  These methods are
also independent of the current locale.

This means that setting the locale in an application will not affect the
performance of RE/flex scanners and regex matchers.

As a side note, to display wide strings properly and to save wide strings to
UTF-8 text files, it is generally recommended to set the UTF-8 locale.  For
example:

~~~{.cpp}
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.UTF-8");        // setlocale UTF-8
    std::ifstream ifs("file.txt", std::ios::in);  // open UTF-8/16/32 text file
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", ifs);    // not affected by setlocale
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
    {
      std::wstring& match = matcher.wstr();       // not affected by setlocale
      std::wcout << match << std::endl;           // affected by setlocale
    }
    ifs.close();
~~~

This displays wide string matches in UTF-8 on most consoles and terminals, but
not on all systems (I'm looking at you, Mac OS X terminal!)  Instead of
`std::wcout` we can use `std::cout` instead to display UTF-8 content directly:

~~~{.cpp}
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.UTF-8");       // setlocale UTF-8
    std::ifstream ifs("file.txt", std::ios::in); // open UTF-8/16/32 text file
    reflex::PCRE2Matcher matcher("\\w+", ifs);   // not affected by setlocale
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
    {
      std::string& match = matcher.str();        // not affected by setlocale
      std::cout << match << std::endl;           // not affected by setlocale
    }
    ifs.close();
~~~

Scanning ISO-8859-1 (latin-1) files with a Unicode scanner        {#iso-8859-1}
----------------------------------------------------------

Scanning files encoded in ISO-8859-1 by a Unicode scanner that expects UTF-8
will cause the scanner to misbehave or throw errors.

Many text files are still encoded in ISO-8859-1 (also called latin-1).  To set
up your scanner to safely scan ISO-8859-1 content when your scanner rules use
Unicode (with the `‚àí‚àíunicode` option and your patterns that use UTF-8
encodings), set the default file encoding to `latin`:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Input input(stdin, reflex::Input::file_encoding::latin);
    Lexer lexer(input);
    lexer.lex();
~~~

This scans files from standard input that are encoded in ISO-8859-1, unless the
file has a [UTF Byte Order Mark (BOM)](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html).
When a BOM is detected the scanner switches to UTF scanning.

See \ref regex-input-file to set file encodings.

Files with CRLF pairs                                                   {#crlf}
---------------------

DOS files and other DOS or Windows input sources typically end lines with CRLF
byte pairs.  There are two ways to effectively deal with CRLF pairs:

1. Use `reflex::Input::dos_streambuf` to automatically convert
   \ref regex-input-dosstreambuf by creating a `std::istream` for the specified
   `reflex::Input::dos_streambuf`.  Due to the extra layer introduced in the
   input processing stack, this option adds some overhead but requires no
   changes to the patterns and application code.

2. Rewrite the patterns to match both `\n` and `\r\n` to allow CRLF line
   endings.  This is option is fast to process input, but requires specialized
   patterns and the matched multi-line text will include `\r` (CR) characters
   that may need to be dealt with by the application code.

To rewrite your patterns to support CRLF end-of-line matching:

- Replace `\n` in patterns by `\r?\n`.

- Replace `.*` in patterns by `([^\n\r]|\r[^\n])*` to match any non-newline
  characters.  Likewise replace `.+` by its longer version.  Note that a single
  `.` can still be used in patterns but may match a `\r` just before a `\n`
  when a CRLF is encountered.

With the above changes, reading files on Windows systems in "binary mode" is
recommended, i.e. open `FILE*` files with the `"rb"` mode.

Reading a file in the default "text mode" interprets ^Z (0x1A) as EOF.  The
latest RE/flex releases automatically switch `FILE*` input to binary mode on
Windows systems when the file is encoded in UTF-16 or UTF-32, but not UTF-8.

Handling old Macintosh files containing CR newlines                       {#cr}
---------------------------------------------------

Old Macintosh OS file formats prior to Mac OS X use CR to end lines instead of
LF.  To automatically read and normalize files encoded in MacRoman containing
CR as newlines, you can use the `reflex::Input::file_encoding::macroman` file
encoding format.  This normalizes the input to UTF-8 and translates CR newlines
to LF newlines.  See \ref regex-input-file for details.

Alternatively, you can define a custom code page to translate CR to LF without
normalizing to UTF-8:

~~~{.cpp}
    #define LF 10
    static const unsigned short CR2LF[256] = {
        0,   1,   2,    3,    4,    5,    6,    7,    8,    9,   10,   11,   12,   LF,   14,   15,
       16,  17,  18,   19,   20,   21,   22,   23,   24,   25,   26,   27,   28,   29,   30,   31,
       32,  33,  34,   35,   36,   37,   38,   39,   40,   41,   42,   43,   44,   45,   46,   47,
       48,  49,  50,   51,   52,   53,   54,   55,   56,   57,   58,   59,   60,   61,   62,   63,
       64,  65,  66,   67,   68,   69,   70,   71,   72,   73,   74,   75,   76,   77,   78,   79,

Lazy repetitions                                                        {#lazy}
----------------

Repetitions (`*`, `+`, and `{n,m}`) and the optional pattern (`?`) are greedy,
unless marked with an extra `?` to make them lazy.  Lazy repetitions are
useless when the regex pattern after the lazy repetitions permits empty input.
For example, `.*?a?` only matches one `a` or nothing at all, because `a?`
permits an empty match.

Lazy optional patterns and trigraphs                               {#trigraphs}
------------------------------------

This C/C++ trigraph problem work-around does not apply to lexer specifications
that the <b>`reflex`</b> command converts while preventing trigraphs.

Trigraphs in C/C++ strings are special tripple-character sequences, beginning
with two question marks and followed by a character that is translated.  For
example, `"x??(y|z)"` is translated to `"x[y|z)"`.

Fortunately, most C++ compilers ignore trigraphs unless in standard-conforming
modes, such as `-ansi` and `-std=c++98`.

When using the lazy optional pattern `œÜ??` in a regex C/C++ string for pattern
matching with one of the RE/flex matchers for example, use `œÜ?\?` instead,
which the C/C++ compiler translates to `œÜ??`.

Otherwise, lazy optional pattern constructs will appear broken.

Repeately switching to the same input                              {#switching}
-------------------------------------

The state of the input object `reflex::Input` changes as the scanner's matcher
consumes more input.  If you switch to the same input again (e.g. with `in(i)`
or `switch_stream(i)` for input source `i`), a portion of that input may end up
being discarded as part of the matcher's internal buffer is flushed when input
is assigned.  Therefore, the following code will not work because stdin is
flushed repeately:

~~~{.cpp}
    Lexer lexer(stdin);       // a lexer that reads stdin
    lexer.in(stdin);          // this is OK, nothing read yet
    while (lexer.lex(stdin))  // oops, assigning stdin again and again
      std::cout << "we're not getting anywhere?" << std::endl;
~~~

If you need to read a file or stream again, you have two options:

1. Save the current matcher and its input state with `push_matcher(m)` or
   `yypush_buffer_state(m)` to start using a new matcher `m`, e.g. created
   with `reflex::Matcher m = new_matcher(i)` to consume the specified input `i`.
   Restore the original matcher with `pop_matcher()` or `yypop_buffer_state()`.
   See also \ref reflex-multiple-input.

2. Rewind the file to the location in the file to start reading.  Beware
   that `FILE*` input is checked against an UTF BOM at the start of a file,
   which means that you cannot reliably move to an arbitrary location in the
   file to start reading when the file is encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.

Where is FlexLexer.h?                                              {#flexlexer}
---------------------

RE/flex uses its own header file <i>`reflex/flexlexer.h`</i> for compatibility
with Flex, instead of the Flex file `FlexLexer.h`.  The latter is specific to
Flex and cannot be used with RE/flex.  You should not have to include
<i>`FlexLexer.h`</i> but if you do, use:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <reflex/flexlexer.h>
~~~

The `FlexLexer` class defined in <i>`reflex/flexlexer.h`</i> is the base class
of the generated `yyFlexLexer` class.  A name for the generated lexer class can
be specified with option `‚àí‚àílexer=NAME`.

Interactive input with GNU readline                                 {#readline}
-----------------------------------

Option `-I` for interactive input generates a scanner that uses `fgetc()` to
read input from a `FILE*` descriptor (stdin by default).  Interactive input is
made more user-friendly with the GNU readline library that provides basic line
editing and a history mechanism.

To use `readline()` in your lexer, call `readline()` in your Lexer's
constructor and in the `wrap()` method as follows:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %top{
      #include <stdlib.h>
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <readline/readline.h>
      #include <readline/history.h>
    }

    %class{
      const char *prompt;
      // we use wrap() to read the next line
      virtual bool wrap() {
        if (line)
        {
          free((void*)line);
          line = readline(prompt);
          if (line != NULL)
          {
            if (*line)
              add_history(line);
            linen.assign(line).push_back('\n');
            in(linen);
          }
        }
        // wrap() == true means OK: wrapped after EOF
        return line != NULL;
      }
      // the line returned by readline() without \n
      char *line;
      // the line with \n appended
      std::string linen;
    }

    %init{
      prompt = NULL;
      line = readline(prompt);
      if (line != NULL)
      {
        if (*line)
          add_history(line);
        linen.assign(line).push_back('\n');
      }
      in(linen);
    }
~~~
</div>

With option `‚àí‚àíflex` you will need to replace `wrap()` by a Flex-like
`yywrap()` and change it to return 0 on success:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
      // we use yywrap() in Flex mode to read the next line
      virtual int yywrap() {
        if (line)
        {
          free((void*)line);
          line = readline(prompt);
          if (line != NULL)
          {
            if (*line)
              add_history(line);
            linen.assign(line).push_back('\n');
            in(linen);
          }
        }
        // yywrap() == 0 means OK: wrapped after EOF
        return line != NULL ? 0 : 1;
      }
~~~
</div>

The rules can be matched as usual, where `\n` matches the end of a line, for
example:

<div class="alt">
~~~{.cpp}
    %%

    .+  echo(); // ECHO the entire line
    \n  echo(); // ECHO end of the line

    %%
~~~
</div>

Registering a handler to support non-blocking reads                 {#nonblock}
---------------------------------------------------

When `FILE*` input is read, the read operation performed with an `fread` by the
`reflex::Input` class should normally block until data is available.
Otherwise, when no data is available, an EOF condition is set and further reads
are blocked.

To support error recovery and non-blocking `FILE*` input, an event handler
can be registered.  This handler is invoked when no input is available (i.e.
`fread` returns zero) and the end of the file is not reached yet (i.e. `feof()`
returns zero).

The handler should be derived from the `reflex::Inout::Handler` abstract base
functor class as follows:

~~~{.cpp}
    struct NonBlockHandler : public reflex::Input::Handler {
      NonBlockHandler(State& state)
      :
        state(state)
      { }

      // state info: the handler does not need to be stateless
      // for example this can be the FILE* or reflex::Input object
      State& state;

      // the functor operator invoked by the reflex::Input class when fread()==0 and feof()==0
      int operator()()
      {
        ... // perform some operation here

        return 0; // do not continue, signals end of input
        return 1; // continue reading, which may fail again
      }
    };
~~~

When your event handler allows non-blocking reads to continue, make sure that
your handler does not return nonzero without delay.  A busy loop is otherwise
the result that unnecessarily burns CPU cycles.  Instead of a fixed delay,
`select()` can be effectively used to wait for input to become ready again:

~~~{.cpp}
    while (true)
    {
      struct timeval tv;
      fd_set fds;
      FD_ZERO(&fds);
      int fd = fileno(in.file());
      FD_SET(fd, &fds);
      tv.tv_sec = 1;
      tv.tv_usec = 0;
      int r = ::select(fd + 1, &fds, NULL, &fds, &tv);
      if (r < 0 && errno != EINTR)
        return 0;
      if (r > 0)
        return 1;
    }
~~~

Here we wait in periods of one second until data is pending on the `FILE*`
stream `in.file()`, where `in` is a `reflex::Input` object.  This object can
be part of the `NonBlockHandler` state.  A timeout can be implemented by
bounding the number of loop iterations.

Note that a `FILE*` stream is set to non-blocking mode in Unix/Linux with
`fcntl()`.  Your handler is registered with `reflex::Input::set_handler()`:

~~~{.cpp}
    #include <fcntl.h>

    FILE *file = ...;
    int fd = fileno(file);
    fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) | O_NONBLOCK);
    reflex::Input in(file);
    NonBlockHandler nonblock_handler(in);
    in.set_handler(&nonblock_handler);
    ...
    fclose(in.file());
~~~

The custom event handler can also be used to detect and clear `FILE*` errors by
checking if an error conditions exist on the `FILE*` input indicated by
`ferror()`.  Errors are cleared with `clearerr()`.  Note that a non-blocking
read that returns zero always produces nonzero `ferror()` values.

Undefined symbols and link errors                                {#link-errors}
---------------------------------

Some hints when dealing with undefined symbols and link errors when building
RE/flex applications:

- Compilation requires `libreflex` which is linked using compiler option
  `-lreflex`:

      c++ ... -lreflex

  If `libreflex` was not installed on your system then header files cannot be
  found and linking with `-lreflex` fails.  Instead, you can specify the
  include path and link the library with:

      c++ -I<path>/reflex/include ... -L<path>/reflex/lib -lreflex

  where `<path>` is the directory path to the top directory of the downloaded
  RE/flex package.

- When using an IDE such as Visual Studio C++, compile all of the <i>.cpp</i>
  source code files located in the <i>`reflex/lib`</i> and the
  <i>`reflex/unicode`</i> directories of the RE/flex download package.  The
  header files are located in the <i>`reflex/include/reflex`</i> directory.

- When PCRE2 is used as a matcher engine, also link `libpcre2-8`:

      c++ ... -lreflex -lpcre2-8

- When Boost.Regex is used as a matcher engine, also link `libboost_regex`:

      c++ ... -lreflex -lboost_regex

- If you get compilation errors with the `std::regex` matching engine, you
  should compile the source code as C++11:

      c++ -std=c++11 ... -lreflex

- When generating scanners with the <b>`reflex`</b> tool, the generated
  <i>`lex.yy.cpp`</i> lexer logic should be compiled and linked with your
  application.  We use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àíheader-file` to generate
  <i>`lex.yy.h`</i> with the lexer class to include in the source code of your
  lexer application.

Minimized library and (cross) compiling from source                  {#linking}
---------------------------------------------------

RE/flex scanners generated with <b>`reflex`</b> can be linked against a
minimized version of the RE/flex library `libreflexmin`:

    c++ ... -lreflexmin

The regex Unicode converters and the Unicode tables that are not used at run
time are excluded from the minimized library.

If the RE/flex library is not installed, for example when cross-compiling
a RE/flex scanner to a different platform, then compile directly from the
RE/flex C++ source files located in the `reflex/lib` and `reflex/include`
directories as follows:

    c++ -I. -Iinclude lex.yy.cpp lib/debug.cpp lib/error.cpp \
        lib/input.cpp lib/matcher.cpp lib/pattern.cpp lib/utf8.cpp lib/simd.cpp

This compiles the code *without SIMD optimizations*, despite compiling
`lib/simd.cpp`.  SIMD intrinsics for SSE/AVX and ARM NEON/AArch64 are used to
speed up string search and newline detection and counting in the library.
These optimizations are for the most part applicable to speed up searching with
the `reflex::Matcher::find()` method.

To compile with NEON/AArch64 optimizations applied (omit `-mfpu=neon` for AArch64):

    c++ -DHAVE_NEON -mfpu=neon -I. -Iinclude lex.yy.cpp lib/debug.cpp lib/error.cpp \
        lib/input.cpp lib/matcher.cpp lib/pattern.cpp lib/utf8.cpp lib/simd.cpp

To compile with SSE2 optimizations applied:

    c++ -DHAVE_SSE2 -msse2 -I. -Iinclude lex.yy.cpp lib/debug.cpp lib/error.cpp \
        lib/input.cpp lib/matcher.cpp lib/pattern.cpp lib/utf8.cpp lib/simd.cpp

To compile with AVX2 optimizations applied and run-time detection of AVX2 using
SSE2 as a fallback optimization when the CPU does not support AVX2:

    c++ -DHAVE_AVX2 -mavx2 -I. -Iinclude lex.yy.cpp lib/debug.cpp lib/error.cpp \
        lib/input.cpp lib/matcher.cpp lib/pattern.cpp lib/utf8.cpp lib/simd.cpp \
        lib/matcher_avx2.cpp lib/simd_avx2.cpp

To compile with AVX512BW optimizations applied and run-time detection of
AVX512BW using AVX2 or SSE2 as a fallback optimization when the CPU does not
support AVX512BW:

    c++ -DHAVE_AVX512BW -mavx512bw -I. -Iinclude lex.yy.cpp lib/debug.cpp lib/error.cpp \
        lib/input.cpp lib/matcher.cpp lib/pattern.cpp lib/utf8.cpp lib/simd.cpp \
        lib/matcher_avx2.cpp lib/matcher_avx512bw.cpp lib/simd_avx2.cpp lib/simd_avx512bw.cpp

How to minimize runtime memory usage                                {#memusage}
------------------------------------

Runtime memory usage is largely determined by two entities, the pattern DFA and
the input buffer:

- Use <b>`reflex`</b> option `‚àí‚àífull` to create a statically-allocated table
  DFA for the scanner's regular expression patterns or option `‚àí‚àífast` to
  generate a direct-coded DFA.  Without one of these options, by default a DFA
  is created at runtime and stored in heap space.

- Compile the generated source code with `-DREFLEX_BUFSZ=16384` to override
  the internal buffer `reflex::AbstractMatcher::Const::BUFSZ` size.  By
  default, the buffer size is 256K, which is optimal for high-performance file
  searching and tokenization.  The buffer is a sliding window over the input,
  i.e. input files may be much larger than the buffer size.  A reasonably small
  `REFLEX_BUFSZ` is 16384 for a 16K buffer.  A small buffer automatically
  expands to accommodate larger pattern matches.  However, when using the
  `line()` and `wline()` methods, very long lines may not fit and the return
  string values of `line()` and `wline()` may be truncated as a result.
  Furtheremore, a small buffer increase processing time, i.e. to frequently
  move the buffered window along a file and increases the cost to decode
  UTF-16/32 into UTF-8 multibyte sequences.

@warning The value of `REFLEX_BUFSZ` should not be less than 4096.

How to speed up matching and searching with zero copy overhead      {#zerocopy}
--------------------------------------------------------------

All RE/flex matchers, including `reflex::Matcher`, `reflex::PCRE2Matcher`,
`reflex::BoostMatcher`, `reflex::StdMatcher` and `reflex::FuzzyMatcher`, use an
internal buffer of 256K.  This buffer is used to search and match input by
copying the specified input into this buffer.  This allows the input to be
modified, such as writing a zero byte to make the character strings returned by
`text()` and `rest()` always 0-terminated.  The buffer shifts to handle input
larger than 256K by consuming the input in blocks of up to 256K at a time.  The
buffer only grows in size to accomodate pattern matches that are longer than
256K, which will not happen when you specify regex patterns that do not match
byte sequences longer than 256K, e.g. when patterns exclude `\n` (newline)
characters when the input consists of regular lines of text.

When the data you want to search resides in memory, you can eliminate the
overhead of buffer copying as follows.  Before searching or matching the data,
specify the memory region you want to search at address `b` of size `n` with
`reflex::Matcher::buffer(b, n + 1)`.  Note that an extra byte after the end of
the data must be avalable in this memory region, hence we pass `n + 1` to
search `n` bytes.  The final byte at the end of the memory region will be set
to zero when `unput(c)`, `wunput()`, `text()`, `rest()` or `span()` is used.
But otherwise the memory region, including the final byte, remains completely
untouched and you can safely specify `n + 1` even when the allocated region has
`n` bytes of data.

For example:

~~~{.cpp}
    char *base = ...;  // points to the base address of the data
    size_t size = ...; // length of the data including one extra byte
    reflex::Matcher matcher(pattern);
    matcher.buffer(base, size);
    while (matcher.find() != 0)
      std::cout << "Found: " << matcher.str() << std::endl;
~~~

A C++ range-based loop construct to avoid                               {#loop}
-----------------------------------------

When a matcher object is constructed as a temporary in a range-based loop it
will be destroyed when we actually want to use it in the loop to find all
matches.  This means that the following example crashes:

~~~{.cpp}
    for (auto& match : reflex::Matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.").find)
      std::cout << match.text() << std::endl;
~~~

Instead, write:

~~~{.cpp}
    reflex::Matcher matcher("\\w+", "How now brown cow.");
    for (auto& match : matcher.find)
      std::cout << match.text() << std::endl;
~~~

Note that some C++23 compilers handle this just fine as support for range-based
loop temporaries was proposed to the C++ standards committee.
