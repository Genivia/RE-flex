What is RE/flex?                                                       </h1>
<p>RE/flex is a flexible scanner-generator framework for generating regex-centric, Flex-compatible scanners. RE/flex offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>feature-rich replacement</em> of both <a href="dinosaur.compilertools.net/#flex">Flex</a> and <a href="dinosaur.compilertools.net/#lex">Lex</a>;</li>
<li>an <em>enhancement</em> of <a href="www.boost.org/libs/regex">Boost.Regex</a> to use its engine for matching, seaching, splitting and for scanning of tokens on various types of data sources, such as strings, files, and streams of unlimited length.</li>
<li>a stand-alone <em>regex library</em> is included with RE/flex for fast matching with efficient deterministic finite state machines (FSMs) that are contructed from regex patterns with POSIX mode matching extended to support lazy quantifiers, word boundary anchors, Unicode UTF-8, and much more;</li>
<li>a <em>flexible regex framework</em> that combines the above with a collection of C++ class templates that are easy to use and that offer a rich API for searching, matching, scanning, and splitting of input strings, files and streaming data. This framework is flexible and can be extended to include other regex pattern matchers that can operate seamlessly with the RE/flex scanner generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>RE/flex is not merely designed to fix the limitations of Lex and Flex! RE/flex balances efficiency with flexibility by offering a choice of regex engines that are used by the generated scanner. The choice includes Boost.Regex and RE/flex matcher engines that offer a rich regex syntax. The RE/flex POSIX matcher adds lazy quantifiers, word boundary anchors, and other useful patterns to the POSIX mode of matching. Also Unicode character sets and ASCII/UTF-8/16/32 file input is supported by RE/flex, without any additional coding required. RE/flex regex patterns are converted to efficient deterministic finite state machines. These machines differ from Flex in supporting the new pattern-matching features.</p>
<p>RE/flex incorporates proper object-oriented design principles and does not rely on macros and globals as Flex does. Macros and globals are only added when the Flex-compatibility option <code>−−flex</code> is used when invoking the <b>reflex</b> scanner generator. However, in all cases the <b>reflex</b> scanner generator produces C++ scanner classes derived from a base lexer class template, with a matcher engine as the template parameter. An extensible approach to scanner generation.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro1"></a>
Understanding scanner generators                                      </h2>
<p>Lex, Flex and variants are powerful <em>scanner generators</em> that generate scanners (a.k.a. <em>lexical analyzers</em> and <em>lexers</em>) from <em>lex specifications</em>. These lex specifications define patterns with user-defined actions that are executed when their patterns match the input stream. The scanner repeatedly matches patterns and triggers these actions until the end of the input stream is reached.</p>
<p>Both Lex and Flex are popular to develop <em>tokenizers</em> in which the user-defined actions emit or return a <em>token</em> when the corresponding pattern matches. These tokenizers are typically implemented to scan and tokenize the source code for a compiler or an interpreter of a programming language. The <em>regular expression</em> patterns in a tokenizer define the make-up of identifiers, constants, keywords, punctuation, and to skip over white space in the source code that is scanned.</p>
<p>Consider for example the following patterns and associated actions defined in a lex specification:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">/* PATTERN */</span>           <span class="comment">/* ACTION */</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;if&quot;</span>                    <span class="keywordflow">return</span> KEYWORD_IF;</div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;*&quot;</span>                     <span class="keywordflow">return</span> OP_MUL;</div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;=&quot;</span>                     <span class="keywordflow">return</span> OP_ASSIGN;</div>
<div class="line">[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*  <span class="keywordflow">return</span> ASCII_IDENTIFIER;</div>
<div class="line">[0-9]+                  <span class="keywordflow">return</span> CONST_NUMBER;</div>
<div class="line">\<span class="stringliteral">&quot;([^\\&quot;</span>]|\\<span class="stringliteral">&quot;)*\&quot;       return CONST_STRING;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">[ \t\r\n]               /* no action: ignore all white space */</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>When the tokenizer matches a pattern, the corresponding action is invoked. The example above returns tokens to the compiler's parser, which repeatedly invokes the tokenizer for more tokens until the tokenizer reaches the end of the input.</p>
<p>Lex and Flex have remained relatively stable (inert) tools while the demand has increased for tokenizing Unicode texts encoded in common wide character formats such as UTF-8, UCS/UTF-16, and UTF-32. Lex/Flex still use 8-bit character sets for regex patterns.</p>
<p>It is possible, but not trivial to implement scanners with Lex/Flex to tokenize the source code of more modern programming languages with Unicode-based lexical structures such as Java, C#, and C++11.</p>
<p>A possible approach is to use UTF-8 in patterns and reformat the input to UTF-8 for matching. However, the UTF-8 patterns for common Unicode character classes are unrecognizable by humans and are prone to errors when written by hand. The UTF-8 pattern to match a Unicode letter <code>\p{L}</code> is hundreds of lines long!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the regular expression syntax in Lex/Flex is limited to meet POSIX mode matching constraints. Scanners should use POSIX mode matching, as we will explain below, but we have to avoid the "greedy trap" problem as a consequence.</p>
<p>Lex/Flex scanners use POSIX pattern matching, meaning that the leftmost longest match is returned (among a set of patterns that match the same input). Because POSIX matchers produce the longest match for any given input text, we should be careful when using patterns with "greedy" repetitions (<code>X*</code>, <code>X+</code> etc.) because our pattern may gobble up more input than intended. We end up falling into the "greedy trap".</p>
<p>To illustrate this trap consider matching HTML comments <code>&lt;!−− ... −−&gt;</code> with the pattern <code>&lt;!−−.*−−&gt;</code>. The problem is that the repetition <code>X*</code> is greedy and the <code>.*−−&gt;</code> pattern matches everything until the last <code>−−&gt;</code> while moving over <code>−−&gt;</code> that are between the <code>&lt;!−−</code> and the last <code>−−&gt;</code>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Dot <code>.</code> normally does not match newline <code>\n</code> in Lex/Flex patterns, unless we use <em>dot-all mode</em> that is sometimes confusingly called "single line mode".</dd></dl>
<p>We can use much more complex patterns such as <code>&lt;!−−([^−]|−[^−]|−−+[^−&gt;])*−*−−&gt;</code> just to match comments in HTML, by ensuring the pattern ends at the first match of a <code>−−&gt;</code> in the input and not at the very last <code>−−&gt;</code> in the input. The POSIX leftmost longest match can be surprisingly effective in rendering our tokenizer into works of ASCII art!</p>
<p>We may claim our intricate pattern trophies as high achievements to the project team, but our team will quickly point out that a regex <code>&lt;!−−.*?−−&gt;</code> suffices to match HTML comments with the <em>lazy repetition</em> <code>X*?</code> construct, also known as a <em>non-greedy repeat</em>. The <code>?</code> is a <em>lazy quantifier</em> that modifies the behavior of the <code>X*?</code> repeat to match only <code>X</code> repeately if the rest of the pattern does not match. Therefore, the regex <code>&lt;!−−.*?−−&gt;</code> matches HTML comments and nothing more.</p>
<p>But POSIX matching with Lex/Flex will not permit us to be lazy!</p>
<p>Not surprising, even the Flex manual shows ad-hoc code rather than a pattern to scan over C/C++ source code input to match multiline comments that start with a <code>/*</code> and end with the first occurrence of a <code>*/</code>. The Flex manual recommends:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;/*&quot;</span>    {  <span class="comment">/* skip multiline comments */</span></div>
<div class="line">  <span class="keywordtype">int</span> c;</div>
<div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">while</span> ((c = yyinput()) != 0)</div>
<div class="line">  {</div>
<div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (c == <span class="charliteral">&#39;\n&#39;</span>)</div>
<div class="line">      ++mylineno;</div>
<div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">else</span> <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (c == <span class="charliteral">&#39;*&#39;</span>)</div>
<div class="line">    {</div>
<div class="line">      <span class="keywordflow">if</span> ((c = yyinput()) == <span class="charliteral">&#39;/&#39;</span>)</div>
<div class="line">        <span class="keywordflow">break</span>;</div>
<div class="line">      unput(c);</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">  }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Workarounds such as these are not necessary with RE/flex. The RE/flex scanners use regex libraries with more expressive RE syntax. We can use lazy repetition to write a regex pattern for multiline comments as follows:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;/*&quot;</span>(.|\n)*?<span class="stringliteral">&quot;*/&quot;</span>  <span class="comment">/* no action: ignore multiline comments */</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Most regex libraries support syntaxes and features that we have come to rely on for pattern matching. A regex with lazy quantifiers can be much easier to read and comprehend compared to a greedy variant. Most regex libraries that support lazy quantifiers run in Perl mode, using backtracking over the input. Scanners use POSIX mode matching, meaning that the leftmost longest match is found. The difference is important as we saw earlier and even more so when we consider the problems with Perl mode matching when specifying patterns to tokenize input, as we will explain next.</p>
<p>Consider the lex specification at the start of this section. Suppose the input to tokenize is <code>iflag = 1</code>. In POSIX mode we return <code>ASCII_IDENTIFIER</code> for the name <code>iflag</code>, <code>OP_ASSIGN</code> for <code>=</code>, and <code>NUMBER</code> for <code>1</code>. In Perl mode, we find that <code>iflag</code> matches <code>if</code> and the rest of the name is not consumed, which gives <code>KEYWORD_IF</code> for <code>if</code>, <code>ASCII_IDENTIFIER</code> for <code>lag</code>, <code>OP_ASSIGN</code> for <code>=</code>, and a <code>NUMBER</code> for <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Using Perl mode in a scanner requires all overlapping patterns to be defined in a lex specification with longer patterns defined first to avoid partial matches of tokens as demonstrated. By contrast, POSIX mode is <em>declarative</em> and allows you to define the patterns in the specification in any order. Perhaps the only ordering constraint on patterns is for patterns that match the same input, such such as matching the keyword <code>if</code> in the example: <code>KEYWORD_IF</code> must be matched before <code>ASCII_IDENTIFIER</code>.</p>
<p>For this reason, RE/flex scanners use a regex library in POSIX mode by default.</p>
<p>The advantages that RE/flex has to offer compared to Lex/Flex are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lex and Flex scanners are restricted to ASCII or 8-bit character sets without adequate support for Unicode. RE/flex specifications are extended to support Unicode such that the RE/flex scanner generator produces scanners that handle UTF-8/16/32 input files.</li>
<li>The regular expression syntax of patterns in lex specifications is restricted to POSIX ERE. By contrast, the RE/flex scanner generator is "regex-based" by design and offers a rich pattern syntax including lazy quantifiers.</li>
<li>The RE/flex scanner generator takes a lex specification that is compatible to <a href="dinosaur.compilertools.net/#flex">Flex</a>, with additional options to select a matcher engine and to specify names and options for C++ class generation.</li>
<li>RE/flex scanners are not implemented as a set of global functions and tables. RE/flex scanners are instances of generated lexer classes. Thus are MT-safe. A lexer class is derived from an abstract base lexer class template and it is instantiated with a regex matcher engine class as template parameter.</li>
<li>A matcher engine for a lexer class has a common interface API declared by the abstract base matcher class template.</li>
<li>The RE/flex scanner generator includes an option to produce a scanner that is fully compatible with <a href="dinosaur.compilertools.net/#bison">Bison</a> by declaring and implementing a global scanner. RE/flex also generates Bison bridge (pure reentrant and MT-safe) parsers.</li>
<li>Input to matcher engines and scanners is implemented as a class that supports streaming sources of input and automatically decodes UTF-encoded files.</li>
<li>RE/flex scanners can be stand-alone applications, similar to Flex scanners.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next part of this manual, we will take a quick look at the RE/flex regex API that can be used as a stand-alone library for matching, searching, scanning and splitting input from strings, files and streams in regular C++ applications that are not tokenizers for compilers.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex">The RE/flex scanner generator </a> for more details on the RE/flex scanner generator tool. In the next section we will introduce the RE/flex pattern matching library that can be used as a stand-alone pattern matcher for C++ applications.</p>
<p>⇢ <a href="#">Back to contents</a></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro2"></a>
The RE/flex regex library and Boost.Regex                             </h2>
<p>The RE/flex regex API is common interface implemented in an abstract base class template <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_abstract_matcher.html">reflex::AbstractMatcher</a></code> from which regex matchers are derived. This regex API offers a common interface that is used in the generated scanner. The API can also be used in C++ to satisfy any pattern matching needs.</p>
<p>The RE/flex abstract matcher offers four operations for matching with the regex engines that are derived from this base abstract class:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Method </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>matches()</code> </td><td>true if the input from begin to end matches the regex pattern </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>find()</code> </td><td>search input and return true if a match was found </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>scan()</code> </td><td>scan input and return true if input at current position matches </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>split()</code> </td><td>split input at the next match </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The methods are repeatable, where the last three return additional matches.</p>
<p>For example, to check if a string is a valid date:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#include &quot;<a class="code" href="boostmatcher_8h.html">boostmatcher.h</a>&quot;</span> <span class="comment">// reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex</span></div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"><span class="comment">// use a BoostMatcher to check if the birthdate string is a valid date</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">if</span> (<a class="code" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher.html">reflex::BoostMatcher</a>(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}&quot;</span>, birthdate).matches())</div>
<div class="line">  std::cout &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;Valid date!&quot;</span> &lt;&lt; std::endl;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>To search a string for words <code>\w+</code>:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#include &quot;<a class="code" href="boostmatcher_8h.html">boostmatcher.h</a>&quot;</span> <span class="comment">// reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex</span></div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"><span class="comment">// use a BoostMatcher to search for words in a sentence</span></div>
<div class="line"><a class="code" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher.html">reflex::BoostMatcher</a> matcher(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;\\w+&quot;</span>, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;How now brown cow.&quot;</span>);</div>
<div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">while</span> (matcher.find() == <span class="keyword">true</span>)</div>
<div class="line">  std::cout &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;Found &quot;</span> &lt;&lt; matcher.text() &lt;&lt; std::endl;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>When executed this code prints: </p><pre class="fragment">Found How
Found now
Found brown
Found cow
</pre><p>The <code>scan</code> method is similar to the <code>find</code> method, but <code>scan</code> matches only from the current position in the input. It fails when the next match does not start from the current position. Scanning an input source means that matches must be continuous in this input source.</p>
<p>The <code>split</code> method is roughly the inverse of the <code>find</code> method and returns text located between matches. For example using non-word matching <code>\W+</code>:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#include &quot;<a class="code" href="boostmatcher_8h.html">boostmatcher.h</a>&quot;</span> <span class="comment">// reflex::BoostMatcher, reflex::Input, boost::regex</span></div>

<div class="line"><a class="code" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher.html">reflex::BoostMatcher</a> matcher(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;\\W+&quot;</span>, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;How now brown cow.&quot;</span>);</div>
<div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">while</span> (matcher.split() == <span class="keyword">true</span>)</div>
<div class="line">  std::cout &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;Found &quot;</span> &lt;&lt; matcher.text() &lt;&lt; std::endl;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>When executed this code prints: </p><pre class="fragment">Found How
Found now
Found brown
Found cow
Found
</pre><p>Note that split also returns the (possibly empty) remaining text after the last match, as you can see in the output above: the last split with <code>\W+</code> returns an empty string, which is the remaining input after the period in the sentence.</p>
<p>The four regex engines currently available as classes in the <code>reflex</code> namespace are:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Class </th><th>Mode </th><th>Engine </th><th>Performance  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Matcher</code> </td><td>POSIX </td><td>RE/flex lib </td><td>deterministic finite automaton </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>BoostMatcher</code> </td><td>Perl </td><td>Boost.Regex </td><td>regex backtracking </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>BoostPerlMatcher</code> </td><td>Perl </td><td>Boost.Regex </td><td>regex backtracking </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>BoostPosixMatcher</code> </td><td>POSIX </td><td>Boost.Regex </td><td>regex backtracking </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The RE/flex regex engine uses a deterministic finite state machine (FSM) to get the best performance when matching. However, constructing a FSM adds overhead. This matcher is better suitable for searching long texts. The FSM construction overhead can be eliminated by pre-converting the regex to C++ code tables ahead of time as we will see later.</p>
<p>The Boost.Regex engines normally use Perl mode matching. We added a POSIX mode Boost.Regex engine class for the RE/flex scanner generator. Scanners typically use POSIX mode matching. See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-posix-perl">POSIX versus Perl matching </a> for more information.</p>
<p>The Boost.Regex engines are all initialized with <code>match_not_dot_newline</code>, which disables dotall matching as the default setting. Dotall can be re-enabled with the <code>(?s)</code> regex mode modifier. This is done for compatibility with scanners.</p>
<p>A matcher can be applied to strings and wide strings, such as <code>std::string</code> and <code>std::wstring</code>, <code>char*</code> and <code>wchar_t*</code>. Wide strings are converted to UTF-8 to enable matching with regular expressions that contain Unicode patterns.</p>
<p>You can pattern match text in files. File contents are streamed and not loaded as a whole into memory, meaning that the data stream is not limited in size and matching happens immediately. Interactive mode permits matching the input from a console (a TTY device generates a potentially endless stream of characters):</p>

The functor operation returns true upon success. The use of an iterator is simply supported by invoking <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> methods of the functor, which return <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_abstract_matcher.html#a7237c1fb8ab2a2283117739e6516c31f" title="std::input_iterator for scanning, searching, and splitting input character sequences ...">reflex::AbstractMatcher::iterator</a></code>. Likewise, there are also <code>cbegin()</code> and <code>cend()</code> methods that return a <code>const_iterator</code>.</p>
<p>We can use these RE/flex iterators in C++ for many tasks, including to populate containers by stuffing the iterator's text matches into it:</p>

<p>Casting a matcher object to <code>const char*</code> is the same as invoking <code>text()</code>, and the cast is implicitly applied in the example above where the matcher object is cast to the matched text that is then used to instantiate <code>std::string</code> for the <code>words</code> vector. Beware that <code>text()</code> or a cast to <code>const char*</code> simply returns a pointer to an internal buffer. Because this pointer is no longer valid after the matcher continued, we should store the matched text in a <code>std::string</code>.</p>
<p>RE/flex iterators are useful in C++11 range-based loops. For example:</p>

<table class="doxtable">

<p>The first three methods return values that can also be obtained by type casting the matcher object to <code>size_t</code> (or to an integer type), to <code>const char*</code> (or to <code>std::string</code>), and to <code>std::pair&lt;size_t,const char*&gt;</code> (or to a type-compatible form such as <code>std::pair&lt;uint64_t,std::string&gt;</code>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>When using the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a></code> class, the <code>accept()</code> method returns the accepted pattern among the alternations in the regex that are specified only at the top level in the regex. For example, the regex <code>"(a(b)c)|([A-Z])"</code> has two groups, because only the outer top-level groups are recognized. Because groups are specified at the top level only, the grouping parenthesis are optional. We can simplify the regex to <code>"a(b)c|[A-Z]"</code> and still capture the two patterns.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>The <code>text()</code> method returns the match by pointing to the <code>const char*</code> string that is stored in an internal buffer. This pointer <em>should not be used</em> after matching continues and when the matcher object is deallocated.

<p>Two special methods can be used to manipulate the input stream directly:</p>
<table class="doxtable">

<tr>
<td><code>unput(c)</code> </td><td>put character <code>c</code> back unto the stream, matcher then takes it </td></tr>
</table>
<p>To initialize a matcher for interactive use, to assign a new input source or to change its pattern, you can use the following methods:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>

<td><code>input(i)</code> </td><td>set input to <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a> i</code> (string, stream, or <code>FILE*</code>) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pattern(p)</code> </td><td>set pattern to <code>p</code> (string regex or <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern.html">reflex::Pattern</a></code>) </td></tr>

We can also use the RE/flex <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a></code> class for pattern matching. The API is exactly the same. The <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a></code> class uses <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern.html">reflex::Pattern</a></code>, which internally represents an efficient finite state machine that is compiled from a regex. These state machines are used for fast matching.</p>
<p>The construction of deterministic finite state machines (FSMs) is optimized but can take some time and therefore adds overhead before matching can start. This FSM construction should not be executed repeatedly if it can be avoided. So we recommend to construct static pattern objects to create the FSMs only once:</p>

<li>RE/flex defines an extensible abstract class interface that offers a standard API to use regex matcher engines. The API is used by the generated scanners. The API supports UTF-8/16/32-encoded FILE content, wide strings and streaming data.</li>
<li>RE/flex includes a regex matcher class and a regex pattern class to implement fast matching with deterministic finite state machines (FSMs). The FSM graph can be visualized with the Graphviz dot tool. Furthermore, this FSM can also be exported and imported as source code to expedite pattern matching.</li>

The RE/flex scanner generator                                         </h1>
<p>The RE/flex scanner generator tool takes a lex specification and generates a regex-based C++ lexer class that is saved in lex.yy.cpp, or saved to the file specified by the <code>-o</code> command-line option. This file is then compiled and linked with a regex-library to produce a scanner. A scanner can be a stand-alone application or part of a larger program such as a compiler:</p>

<map name="dot_inline_dotgraph_2.map" id="dot_inline_dotgraph_2.map"></map>
</div>
<p>The RE/flex-generated scanners use the RE/flex regex library API for pattern matching. The RE/flex regex library API is defined by the abstract class <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_abstract_matcher.html">reflex::AbstractMatcher</a></code>.</p>
<p>There are two regex matching engines to choose from for the generated scanner: the Boost.Regex library (assuming Boost.Regex is installed) or the RE/flex POSIX matcher engine.</p>
<p>The input class <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a></code> manages input from strings, wide strings, streams, and data from <code>FILE</code> descriptors. File data may be encoded in ASCII, binary or in UTF-8/16/32. UTF-16/32 is automatically converted to UTF-8 for UTF-8-based regex matching:</p>

<p>The <b>reflex</b> command generates a C++ scanner class in a source code file given a lex specification. The <b>reflex</b> command accepts <code>−−flex</code> and <code>−−bison</code> options for compatibility. These options allow <b>reflex</b> to be used as a replacement of the classic Flex and Lex tools: </p><pre class="fragment">$ reflex −−flex −−bison lexspec.l
</pre><p>The first option <code>−−flex</code> specifies that <code>lexspec.l</code> is a classic Lex specification with <code>yytext</code> or <code>YYText()</code> and the usual <code>yy</code> variables and functions.</p>
<p>The second option <code>−−bison</code> generates a scanner class and auxiliary code for compatibility with <a href="dinosaur.compilertools.net/#bison">Bison</a> parsers. See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-bison">Interfacing with Bison and Yacc </a> for more details.</p>
<p>The source code output is intentionally structured in sections that are clean, readable, and reusable.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="reflex-spec"></a>
Lex specifications                                               </h2>
<p>A lex specification consists of three sections that are divided by <code>%%</code> delimiters:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">Definitions</div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line">Rules</div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line">User code</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The Definitions section is used to define named regex patterns, to set options for the scanner, and for including C++ declarations.</p>
<p>The Rules section is the main workhorse of the scanner and consists of patterns and actions, where patterns may use named regex patterns that are defined in the definitions section. The actions are executed when patterns match. For example, the following lex specification replaces all occurrences of <code>cow</code> by <code>chick</code>:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line">cow      out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;chick&quot;</span>;</div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The default rule is to echo any input character that is read from input that does not match a rule in the rules section, so all other text is faithfully reproduced.</p>
<p>Because the pattern <code>cow</code> also matches words partly we get <code>chicks</code> for <code>cows</code>. But we also get badly garbled output for words such as <code>coward</code> and we are skipping capitalized Cows. We can improve this with a pattern that anchors word boundaries and accepts a lower or upper case C:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">cow      \&lt;[Cc]ow\&gt;</div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line">{cow}    out() &lt;&lt; text()[0] &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;hick&quot;</span>;</div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Note that we defined a named pattern <code>cow</code> in the definitions section to match the start and end of (capitalized) "cow" word with the regex <code>\&lt;[Cc]ow\&gt;</code>. We use <code>{cow}</code> in our rule for matching. The matched text first character is emitted with <code>text()[0]</code> and we simply add "hick" to complete our chick.</p>
<p>Note that regex grouping with parenthesis to capture text matched by a parenthesized sub-regex is generally not supported by scanner generators, so we have to use the entire matched <code>text()</code> string.</p>
<p>Flex and Lex do not support word boundary anchors <code>\&lt;</code>, <code>\&gt;</code>, <code>\b</code>, and <code>\B</code> so this example only works with RE/flex.</p>
<p>If you are wondering about the action code in our example not exactly reflecting the C code expected with Flex, then rest assured that RE/flex supports the classic Flex and Lex actions such as <code>yytext</code> instead of <code>text()</code> and <code>*yyout</code> instead of <code>out()</code>. Simply use option <code>−−flex</code> to regress to the C-style Flex names and actions. Use options <code>−−flex</code> and <code>−−bison</code> to regress even further to generated a global <code>yylex()</code> function and <code>yy</code> variables.</p>
<p>To create a stand-alone scanner, we add <code>main</code> to the user code section:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">cow      \&lt;[Cc]ow\&gt;</div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line">{cow}    out() &lt;&lt; text()[0] &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;hick&quot;</span>;</div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">int</span> <a class="code" href="reflex_8cpp.html#a3c04138a5bfe5d72780bb7e82a18e627">main</a>() { <span class="keywordflow">return</span> Lexer().lex(); }</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The main function instantiates the lexer class and invokes the scanner, which will not return until the entire input is processed.</p>
<h3>The definitions section</h3>
<p>The Definitions section includes name-pattern pairs to define names for patterns. Named patterns can be referenced in regex patterns by embracing them in <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.</p>
<p>The following example defines two names for two patterns, where the second regex pattern uses the previously named pattern:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">digit     [0-9]</div>
<div class="line">number    {digit}+</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Names must be defined before being referenced. Names are expanded as macros in regex patterns. For example, <code>{digit}+</code> is expanded into <code>[0-9]+</code>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This is not entirely accurate: when a name is expanded to its right-hand side <code>X</code>, <code>X</code> is placed in a non-capturing group <code>(?:X)</code> to preserve its structure. For example, <code>{number}</code> expands to <code>(?:{digit}+)</code> which in turn expands to <code>(?:(?:[0-9])+)</code>.</dd></dl>
<p>To inject code into the generated scanner, indent the code or place the code within a <code>%{</code> and <code>%}</code>. The <code>%{</code> and <code>%}</code> should be placed at the start of a new line. To inject code at the very top of the generated scanner, place this code within <code>top{</code> and <code>%}</code>:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%top{</div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">  #include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>    <span class="comment">// std::cout etc.</span></div>
<div class="line">%}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The Definition section may also contain one or more options with <code>%option</code> (or <code>%o</code> for short). For example:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%option dotall <a class="code" href="reflex_8cpp.html#a3c04138a5bfe5d72780bb7e82a18e627">main</a></div>
<div class="line">%o matcher=boost</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Multiple options can be grouped on the same line as is shown above. See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-options">Command-line options </a> for a list of available options.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. Say we want to count the number of occurrences of the word "cow" in some text. We declare a global counter, increment the counter when we see a "cow", and finally report the total tally when we reach the end of the input marked by the <code>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> rule:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%option dotall <a class="code" href="reflex_8cpp.html#a3c04138a5bfe5d72780bb7e82a18e627">main</a></div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%top{</div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">  #include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>    <span class="comment">// std::cout etc.</span></div>
<div class="line">%}</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%{</div>
<div class="line">  <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> n = 0;      <span class="comment">// a global static variable to count cows</span></div>
<div class="line">%}</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">cow        \&lt;[Cc]ow\&gt;</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">{cow}      n++;          <span class="comment">// found a cow, bump count by one</span></div>
<div class="line">.          <span class="comment">// do nothing</span></div>
<div class="line">&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;    out() &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot; cows!&quot;</span> &lt;&lt; std::endl; <span class="keywordflow">return</span> 0;</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The above works fine, but we are using a global counter which is not a best practice and is not MT-safe or reentrant: multiple Lexer class instances may compete to bump the counter. Another problem is that the Lexer can only be used once, there is no proper initialization to restart the Lexer on new input.</p>
<p>RE/flex allows you to inject code in the generated Lexer class, meaning that class members and constructor code can be added to manage the Lexer class state. All Lexer class members are visible in actions, even when private. New Lexers can be instantiated given some input to scan. Lexers can run in parallel in threads without requiring synchronization when their state is part of the instance and not managed by global variables.</p>
<p>To inject Lexer class member declarations, place the declarations within <code>%class{</code> and <code>%}</code>. The <code>%class{</code> and <code>%}</code> should be placed at the start of a new line.</p>
<p>Likewise, to inject Lexer class constructor code, for example to initialize members, place the code within <code>%init{</code> and <code>%}</code>. The <code>%init{</code> and <code>%}</code> should be placed at the start of a new line.</p>
<p>For example, we use these code injectors to make our cow counter <code>n</code> part of the Lexer class state:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%option dotall <a class="code" href="reflex_8cpp.html#a3c04138a5bfe5d72780bb7e82a18e627">main</a></div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%top{</div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">  #include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>    <span class="comment">// std::cout etc.</span></div>
<div class="line">%}</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%<span class="keyword">class</span>{</div>
<div class="line">  <span class="keywordtype">int</span> n;     <span class="comment">// lexer class member variable (private by default)</span></div>
<div class="line">%}</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%init{</div>
<div class="line">  n = 0;     <span class="comment">// initialize member variable in Lexer class constructor</span></div>
<div class="line">%}</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">cow        \&lt;[Cc]ow\&gt;</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">{cow}      n++;          <span class="comment">// found a cow, bump count by one</span></div>
<div class="line">.          <span class="comment">// do nothing</span></div>
<div class="line">&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;    out() &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot; cows!&quot;</span> &lt;&lt; std::endl; <span class="keywordflow">return</span> 0;</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Note that nothing else needed to be changed, because the actions are part of the generated Lexer class and can access the Lexer class members, in this example the member variable <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>To modularize lex specifications use <code>%import</code> (or <code>%i</code> for short) to import files into the definitions section of a lex specification. For example:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%<span class="keyword">import</span> <span class="stringliteral">&quot;examples/jdefs.l&quot;</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>This imports examples/jdefs.l with Java patterns into the current specification so you can match Java lexical structures, such as copying Java identifiers to the output given some Java source program as input:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%<span class="keyword">import</span> <span class="stringliteral">&quot;examples/jdefs.l&quot;</span></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line">{Identifier}    echo();</div>
<div class="line">.|\n            <span class="comment">// do nothing</span></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>To declare start condition state names use <code>%state</code> (<code>%s</code> for short) to declare inclusive states and use <code>%xstate</code> (<code>%x</code> for short) to declare exclusive states:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%s INCLUSIVE</div>
<div class="line">%x EXCLUSIVE</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-states">Start condition states </a> for more information about states.</p>
<h3>The rules section</h3>
<p>Each rule in the Rules section consists of a pattern-action pair. For example, the following defines an action for a pattern:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">{number}    out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;number &quot;</span> &lt;&lt; text() &lt;&lt; std::endl;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>To add action code that spans multiple lines, indent the code or place the code within a <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> code block. When local variables are declared in an action then the code should always be placed in a code block.</p>
<p>Actions in the Rules section can use predefined RE/flex variables and functions. With <b>reflex</b> option <code>−−flex</code>, the variables and functions are the classic Flex actions shown in the second column of this table:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>RE/flex action </th><th>Flex action </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>text()</code> </td><td><code>YYText()</code>, <code>yytext</code> </td><td><code>\0</code>-terminated text match </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><code>debug()</code> </td><td><code>debug()</code> </td><td>nonzero when debugging </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note that Flex <code>switch_streams(i, o)</code> is the same as <code>in(i)</code> and <code>out(o)</code>, and Flex <code>yyrestart(i)</code> is just <code>in(i)</code>.</p>
<p>From the above you may have guessed correctly that <code>text()</code> is just a shorthand for <code>matcher().text()</code>, since <code>matcher()</code> is the matcher object associated with the generated Lexer class.</p>
<p>Because <code>matcher()</code> returns the current matcher object, the following Flex-like actions are also supported:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>RE/flex action </th><th>Flex action </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>matcher().buffer()</code> </td><td><code><a class="el" href="flexlexer_8h.html#a83e55b4e09de54e0f7c1b00ebd255a57" title="Flex-compatible macro defining interactive mode on/off. ">yy_set_interactive(0)</a></code> </td><td>buffer all input </td></tr>

<tr>
<td><code>matcher().set_eof(b)</code> </td><td><em>n/a</em> </td><td>set EOF flag to <code>b</code> </td></tr>
</table>
<p>You can switch to a new matcher while scanning input, and use operations to create a new matcher, push/pop a matcher on/from a stack, and delete a matcher:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>RE/flex action </th><th>Flex action </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>matcher(m)</code> </td><td><code>yy_switch_to_buffer(m)</code> </td><td>use matcher <code>m</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>new_matcher(i)</code> </td><td><code>yy_create_buffer(i, n)</code> </td><td>new matcher on input <code>i</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>del_matcher(m)</code> </td><td><code>yy_delete_buffer(m)</code> </td><td>delete matcher <code>m</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>push_matcher(m)</code> </td><td><code>yypush_buffer_state(m)</code> </td><td>push current matcher, use <code>m</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pop_matcher()</code> </td><td><code>yypop_buffer_state()</code> </td><td>pop matcher and delete current </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The generated scanner reads from the standard input by default or from an input source specified as a <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a></code> object, such as a string, wide string, file, or a stream.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-input">Switching input sources </a> for more details on managing the input to a scanner.</p>
<h3>The user code section</h3>
<p>To inject code at the end of the generated scanner, such as a <code>main</code> function, we can use the User Code section. All of the code in the User Code section is copied to the generated scanner.</p>
<p>Below is a User Code section example with <code>main</code> that invokes the lexer to read from standard input (the default input) and display all numbers found:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%top{</div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">  #include &lt;iostream&gt;</span></div>
<div class="line">%}</div>

<div class="line">number      {digit}+</div>

</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>You can also automatically generate a <code>main</code> with the <b>reflex</b> <code>−−main</code> option, which will produce the same <code>main</code> function shown in the example above. This creates a stand-alone scanner that instantiates a Lexer that reads input from standard input.</p>
<p>To scan from other input than standard input, such as from files, streams, and strings, instantiate the Lexer class with the input source as the first argument. To set an alternative output stream than standard output, pass a <code>std::ostream</code> object as the second argument to the Lexer class constructor:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">int</span> <a class="code" href="reflex_8cpp.html#a3c04138a5bfe5d72780bb7e82a18e627">main</a>(<span class="keywordtype">int</span> argc, <span class="keywordtype">char</span> **argv)</div>

<div class="line">  Lexer(fd, of).lex();</div>
<div class="line">  of.close();</div>
<div class="line">  fclose(fd);</div>
<div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">return</span> 0;</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The above uses a <code>FILE</code> descriptor to read input from, which has the advantage of automatic internal UTF-8/16/32 conversion. Other permissible input sources are <code>std::istream</code>, <code>std::string</code>, <code>std::wstring</code>, <code>char*</code>, and <code>wchar_t*</code>.</p>

<h3>Indent and dedent matching</h3>
<p>Automatic indent and dedent matching is a new feature in RE/flex and is enabled when the RE/flex matcher engine is used (not the Boost.Regex matcher).</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Pattern </th><th>Matches  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\i</code> </td><td>indent: indent position is increased </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\j</code> </td><td>dedent: indent position is decreased </td></tr>
</table>
<p>These patterns should be used in combination with the start of a line anchor <code>^</code> followed by a pattern that represents the spacing for indentations. The pattern may include any characters that are considered part of indentation margins, but should exclude <code>\n</code>. For example:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line">^\h+      out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;| &quot;</span>; <span class="comment">// text is aligned to current indent margin</span></div>
<div class="line">^\h*\i    out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;&gt; &quot;</span>; <span class="comment">// indent</span></div>
<div class="line">^\h*\j    out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;&lt; &quot;</span>; <span class="comment">// dedent</span></div>
<div class="line">\j        out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;&lt; &quot;</span>; <span class="comment">// dedent, for each extra level dedented</span></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The <code>\h</code> pattern matches space and tabs, where tabs advance to the next column that is a multiple of 8. The tab multiplier can be changed by setting the <code>−−tabs=N</code> option.</p>
<p>To add a pattern that consumes line continuations without affecting the indentation levels, use a negative match, which is a new RE/flex feature:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">(?^\\\n\h+)    <span class="comment">// lines ending in \ will continue on the next line</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The pattern ignores the match as if the matching text was not part of the input.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The RE/flex matcher engine uses an efficient FSM. There are known limitations to FSM matching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lookaheads (trailing contexts) must appear at the end of a pattern, so <code>a/b</code> and <code>a(?=b)</code> are permitted, but <code>(a/b)c</code> and <code>a(?=b)c</code> are not.</li>
<li>Lookaheads cannot be properly matched when the ending of the first part of the pattern matches the beginning of the second part, such as <code>zx*/xy*</code>, where the <code>x*</code> matches the <code>x</code> at the beginning of the lookahead pattern.</li>
<li>Word boundary anchors must appear at the start or at the end of a pattern, so <code>\&lt;cow\&gt;</code> is permitted, but <code>.*\Bboy</code> is not.</li>
<li>Set operations are not yet implemented, such as <code>[a-z]{-}[aeiou]</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>REJECT</code> action is not supported in RE/flex.</li>
</ul>

<div class="line">%graphs-file=mygraph</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The <b>reflex</b> command-line options are listed below.</p>
<h3><code>−+</code>, <code>−−flex</code></h3>
<p>This generates a <code>yyFlexLexer</code> scanner class that is compatible with the Flex-generated <code>yyFlexLexer</code> scanner class (assuming Flex with option <code>−+</code> for C++). The generated <code>yyFlexLexer</code> class has the usual <code>yytext</code> and other <code>yy</code> variables and functions, as defined by the lex specification standard. Without this option, RE/flex actions should be used that are lexer class methods such as <code>echo()</code> and <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_abstract_matcher.html">reflex::AbstractMatcher</a></code> class methods such as <code>matcher.more()</code>, see <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-spec">Lex specifications </a> for more details.</p>
<h3><code>−−bison</code></h3>
<p>This generates a scanner that works with Bison parsers, by defining global (non-MT-safe and non-reentrant) <code>yy</code> variables and functions. See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-bison">Interfacing with Bison and Yacc </a> for more details.</p>
<h3><code>−−bison-bridge</code></h3>
<p>This generates a scanner that works with Bison pure (MT-safe and reentrant) parsers using a Bison bridge for one ore more scanner objects. See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-bison">Interfacing with Bison and Yacc </a> for more details.</p>
<h3><code>−−main</code></h3>
<p>This generates a <code>main</code> function to create a stand-alone scanner that scans data from stdin standard input.</p>
<h3><code>−−nostdinit</code></h3>
<p>This initializes input to <code>std::cin</code> instead of stdin. Automatic UTF-encoding conversion is not supported. Use stdin for automatic UTF-encoded input conversion.</p>
<h3><code>-u</code>, <code>−−unicode</code></h3>
<p>This makes <code>.</code> (dot), <code>\s</code>, <code>\w</code> match Unicode and groups UTF-8 encoded sequences in the regex, such that each UTF-8 encoded character in a regex is properly matched as one wide character. Note that <code>\S</code> and <code>\W</code> are <em>not affected</em> by this switch.</p>
<h3><code>-a</code>, <code>−−dotall</code></h3>
<p>This makes dot (<code>.</code>) in patterns match newline. Normally dot matches a single character except a newline (<code>\n</code> ASCII 0x0A).</p>
<h3><code>-i</code>, <code>−−case_insensitive</code></h3>
<p>This ignore case in patterns. Patterns match lower and upper case letters. This switch only applies to ASCII letters.</p>
<h3><code>-I</code>, <code>−−interactive</code></h3>
<p>This generates an interactive scanner and permits console input by sacrificing speed. By contrast, buffered (batch) input is more efficient.</p>
<h3><code>-d</code>, <code>−−debug</code></h3>
<p>This enables debug mode in the generated scanner. Running the scanner produces debug messages on <code>std::cerr</code> standard error and the <code>debug()</code> function returns nonzero. To temporarily turn off debug messages, use <code>set_debug(0)</code> in your action code. To turn debug messages back on, use <code>set_debug(1)</code>. The <code>set_debug()</code> and <code>debug()</code> functions are virtual, so you can override their behavior in a derived lexer class.</p>
<h3><code>-s</code>, <code>−−nodefault</code></h3>
<p>This suppresses the default rule that ECHOs all unmatched text when no rule matches.</p>
<h3><code>-R</code>, <code>−−reentrant</code></h3>
<p>This generates additional Flex-compatible <code>yylex()</code> reentrant scanner functions. RE/flex scanners are always reentrant, assuming that no global variables are used by the scanner's user code. This is a Flex-compatibility option for options <code>−−flex</code> and <code>−−bison</code>. See <a class="el" href="index.html#reflex-bison">Interfacing with Bison and Yacc </a>.</p>
<h3><code>-o FILE</code>, <code>−−outfile=FILE</code></h3>
<p>This saves the scanner to FILE instead of yy.lex.cpp.</p>
<h3><code>-t</code>, <code>−−stdout</code></h3>
<p>This writes the scanner to stdout instead of to the yy.lex.cpp file.</p>
<h3><code>-h</code>, <code>−−help</code></h3>
<p>This displays helpful information about <b>reflex</b>.</p>
<h3><code>-V</code>, <code>−−version</code></h3>
<p>This displays the current <b>reflex</b> release version.</p>
<h3><code>-v</code>, <code>−−verbose</code></h3>
<p>This displays a summary of scanner statistics.</p>
<h3><code>-w</code>, <code>−−nowarn</code></h3>
<p>This disables warnings.</p>
<h3><code>-P NAME</code>, <code>−−prefix=NAME</code></h3>
<p>This specifies NAME as a prefix for the generated <code>yyFlexLexer</code> class to replace the default <code>yy</code> prefix. This option is only useful with the <code>−−flex</code> option.</p>
<h3><code>-L</code>, <code>−−noline</code></h3>
<p>This suppresses the #line directives in the generated scanner code.</p>
<h3><code>−−namespace=NAME</code></h3>
<p>This places the generated scanner class in the C++ namespace NAME scope. Which means <code>NAME::Lexer</code> (and <code>NAME::yyFlexLexer</code> when option <code>−−flex</code> is used).</p>
<h3><code>−−lexer=NAME</code></h3>
<p>This defines the NAME of the generated scanner class and replaces the default name <code>Lexer</code> (and replaces <code>yyFlexLexer</code> when option <code>−−flex</code> is used).</p>
<h3><code>−−lex=NAME</code></h3>
<p>This defines the NAME of the generated scanner function to replace the function name <code>lex()</code> (and <code>yylex()</code> when option <code>−−flex</code> is used).</p>
<h3><code>−−class=NAME</code></h3>
<p>This defines the NAME of the scanner class that is derived from the generated base <code>Lexer</code> class. Use this option when defining your own scanner class named NAME. A custom lexer class can be declared in the first section of the lex specification. Because the custom lexer class is already defined, <b>reflex</b> will just generate the implementation of the <code>lex()</code> scanner function for this derived lexer class.</p>
<h3><code>−−yyclass=NAME</code></h3>
<p>This option combines options <code>−−flex</code> and <code>−−class=NAME</code>.</p>
<h3><code>-m reflex</code>, <code>−−matcher=reflex</code></h3>
<p>This generates a scanner that uses the RE/flex <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a></code> class with a POSIX matcher engine. This is the default matcher for scanning. This option is best for Flex compatibility. The matcher supports Unicode (UTF), lazy quantifiers, word boundaries, and optionally produces Graphviz output.</p>
<h3><code>-m boost</code>, <code>−−matcher=boost</code></h3>
<p>This generates a scanner that uses the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_posix_matcher.html">reflex::BoostPosixMatcher</a></code> class with a Boost.Regex POSIX matcher engine for scanning. The matcher supports Unicode and word boundary anchors, but not lazy quantifiers. No Graphviz output.</p>
<h3><code>-m boost-perl</code>, <code>−−matcher=boost-perl</code></h3>
<p>This generates a scanner that uses the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_perl_matcher.html">reflex::BoostPerlMatcher</a></code> class with a Boost.Regex normal (Perl) matcher engine for scanning. The matching behavior deviates from the POSIX <em>leftmost-longest rule</em>, which results in the first matching rule to be applied instead of the rule that produces the longest match. The matcher supports lazy quantifiers and word boundary anchors. No Graphviz output.</p>
<h3><code>-F</code>, <code>−−fast</code></h3>
<p>(RE/flex matcher only). This option adds the FSM to the generated code as a static code table. This means that the FSM construction overhead is eliminated when the scanner is initialized, resulting in a scanner that starts scanning the input immediately.</p>
<h3><code>−−graphs-file[=FILE]</code></h3>
<p>(RE/flex matcher only). This generates a Graphviz file FILE.gv, where FILE is optional. When FILE is omitted the <b>reflex</b> command generates the file reflex.S.gv for each start condition state S defined in the lex specification. This includes reflex.INITIAL.gv for the INITIAL start condition state. This option can be used to visualize the RE/flex matcher's finite state machine with the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz dot</a> tool. For example:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="dot_inline_dotgraph_4.png" alt="dot_inline_dotgraph_4.png" border="0" usemap="#dot_inline_dotgraph_4.map"/>
<map name="dot_inline_dotgraph_4.map" id="dot_inline_dotgraph_4.map"></map>
</div>
<p>In case you are curious: the specification for this FSM digraph has two patterns: [1] a pattern to match dollar amounts with the regex <code>\$\d+(\.\d{2})?</code> and [2] the regex <code>.|\n</code> to skip a character and advance to the next match.</p>
<h3><code>−−header-file[=FILE]</code></h3>
<p>(RE/flex matcher only). This generates a C++ header file FILE.h that declares the lexer class, in addition to the generated lexer class code, where FILE is optional. When FILE is omitted the <b>reflex</b> command generates lex.yy.h.</p>
<h3><code>−−tables-file[=FILE]</code></h3>
<p>(RE/flex matcher only). This generates a C++ file FILE.cpp with the finite state machine in source code form, where FILE is optional. When FILE is omitted the <b>reflex</b> command generates reflex.S.cpp for each start condition state S. This includes the file reflex.INITIAL.cpp for the INITIAL start condition state. When this option is used in combination with <code>−−fast</code>, the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern.html">reflex::Pattern</a></code> is instantiated with the code table defined in this file. Therefore, when combines with <code>−−fast</code> you must compile the generated table file with the scanner. Option <code>−−fast</code> eliminates the FSM construction overhead when the scanner is initialized.</p>
<h3><code>−−pattern=NAME</code></h3>
<p>This defines a custom pattern class NAME for a customer matcher defined with option <code>-m</code>.</p>
<h3><code>−−tabs=N</code></h3>
<p>This sets the tab size to N (N &gt; 0) for indent <code>\i</code> and dedent <code>\j</code> matching.</p>
<h3><code>−−lineno</code>, <code>−−yymore</code> <code>−−yywrap</code>, <code>−−batch</code></h3>
<p>These options are enabled by default and have no effect.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="reflex-posix-perl"></a>
POSIX versus Perl matching                                 </h2>
<p>The <b>reflex</b> scanner generator gives you a choice of matchers to use in the generated scanner, where the default is the POSIX RE/flex matcher engine. Other options are the Boost.Regex matcher in POSIX mode or in Perl mode.</p>
<p>To use a matcher for the generated scanner, use one of these three choices:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Option </th><th>Matcher class used </th><th>Mode </th><th>Engine  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-m reflex</code> </td><td><code>Matcher</code> </td><td>POSIX </td><td>RE/flex lib (default choice) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-m boost</code> </td><td><code>BoostPosixMatcher</code> </td><td>POSIX </td><td>Boost.Regex </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-m boost-perl</code> </td><td><code>BoostPerlMatcher</code> </td><td>Perl </td><td>Boost.Regex </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The POSIX matchers look for the <em>longest possible match</em> among the given set of alternative patterns. Perl matchers look for the <em>first match</em> among the given set of alternative patterns.</p>
<p>POSIX is generally preferred for scanners, since it is easier to arrange rules that may have partially overlapping patterns. Since we are looking for the longest match anyway, it does not matter which rule comes first. The order does not matter as long as the length of the matches differ. When matches are of the same length because multiple patterns match, then the first rule is selected.</p>
<p>Consider for example the following lex specification with rules that are intended to match keywords and identifiers in some input text:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">int</span>                     out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;int keyword\n;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">interface               out() &lt;&lt; &quot;</span><span class="keyword">interface </span>keyword\n;</div>
<div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">float</span>                   out() &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;float keyword\n;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*    out() &lt;&lt; &quot;</span>identifier\n<span class="stringliteral">&quot;;</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral"></span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">%%</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>When the input to the scanner is the text <code>integer</code> then a POSIX matcher selects the last rule, which is what we want because it is an identifier.</p>
<p>By contrast, a Perl matcher selects the first rule because it matches the first part <code>int</code> of <code>integer</code>. This is NOT what we want. The same problem occurs when the text <code>interface</code> is encountered on the input, which we want to recognize as a separate keyword and not match against <code>int</code>. Switching the rules for <code>int</code> and <code>interface</code> fixes that problem. But note that we cannot do the same to fix matching <code>integer</code> as an identifier: when moving the last rule up to the top we cannot match <code>int</code> any longer!</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>To prevent a Perl matcher from matching a keyword when an identifier starts with the name of that keyword, we could use a lookahead pattern such as <code>int(?=[^A-Za-z0-9_])</code> which is written in a lex specification as <code>int/[^A-Za-z0-9_]</code> with the <code>/</code> lookahead meta symbol.</dd></dl>
<p>Basically, a Perl matcher works in an <em>operational</em> mode by working the regex pattern as a sequence of <em>operations</em> for matching, usually using backtracking to find a matching pattern.</p>
<p>A POSIX matcher on the other hand is <em>declarative</em> and have a deeper foundation in formal language theory. An advantage of POSIX matchers is that regular expressions can be compiled to deterministic finite state machines for efficient matching.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>POSIX matching still require moving the <code>int</code> matching rule before the identifier matching rule. Otherwise an <code>int</code> on the input will be matched by the identifier rule.</dd></dl>
<p>Perl matchers generally support lazy quantifiers and group captures, while most POSIX matchers do not (Boost.Regex in POSIX mode does not support lazy quantifiers). The RE/flex POSIX matcher supports lazy quantifiers, but not group captures. The added support for lazy quantifiers and word boundary anchors in RE/flex matching offers a reasonably new and useful feature for scanners that require POSIX mode matching.</p>

Switching input sources                                         </h2>
<p>To create a Lexer class instance that reads from a designated input source instead of standard input, pass the input source as the first argument to its constructor and use the second argument to optionally set an <code>std::ostream</code>:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">Lexer lexer(input, std::cout);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>where <code>input</code> is a <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a></code> object. The <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a></code> constructor takes a <code>FILE*</code> descriptor, <code>std::istream</code>, a string <code>std::string</code> or <code>char*</code>, or a wide string <code>std::wstring</code> or <code>wchar_t*</code>.</p>
<p>To switch input to another source while using the scanner, use <code>in(input)</code>:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// read from a file, this also converts UTF-16/32 encodings automatically</span></div>
<div class="line">FILE *fd = fopen(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;cow.txt&quot;</span>, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;r&quot;</span>);</div>
<div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">if</span> (fd)</div>
<div class="line">  in(fd);</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"><span class="comment">// read from a stream (as is, can be ASCII or UTF-8)</span></div>
<div class="line">std::istream i = std::ifstream(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;file&quot;</span>, std::ifstream::in);</div>
<div class="line">in(i);</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"><span class="comment">// read from a string (as is, can be ASCII or UTF-8)</span></div>
<div class="line">in(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;How now brown cow.&quot;</span>);</div>

<div class="line"><span class="comment">// read from a wide string, encoding it to UTF-8 for matching</span></div>
<div class="line">in(L<span class="stringliteral">&quot;How now brown cow.&quot;</span>);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>However, switching input this way discards the remaining input from a previous input source. To switch input without affecting the current input source, switch matchers instead. The matchers buffer the input and manage the input state, in addition to pattern matching the input.</p>
<p>To switch a matcher that scans from another input source, use</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Matcher *oldmatcher = matcher();</div>
<div class="line">Matcher *newmatcher = new_matcher(input);</div>
<div class="line">matcher(newmatcher);</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">del_matcher(newmatcher);</div>
<div class="line">matcher(oldmatcher);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This switches the scanner's input by switching to another matcher. Note that <code>matcher(m)</code> may be used by the virtual <code>wrap()</code> method (or <code>yywrap()</code> when option <code>−−flex</code> is used) if you use input wrapping after EOF to set things up for continued scanning.</p>
<p>When the scanner reaches the end of the input, it will check the <code>int wrap()</code> method to detetermine if scanning should continue. If <code>wrap()</code> returns one (1) the scanner terminates and returns zero to its caller. If <code>wrap()</code> returns zero (0) then the scanner continues. In this case <code>wrap()</code> should set up a new input source to scan.</p>
<p>To implement a <code>wrap()</code> (and <code>yywrap()</code> when option <code>−−flex</code> is used), create a derived Lexer class using option <code>class=NAME</code> (or <code>yyclass=NAME</code>) and override the <code>wrap()</code> (or <code>yywrap()</code>) method:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%option <span class="keyword">class</span>=Tokenizer</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%{</div>

<div class="line">  };</div>
<div class="line">%}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Switching input sources via either `matcher(m)' or `in(input)' does not change the current start condition state.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>wrap()</code> method to set up a new input source when the current input is exhausted.</p>
<p>A more typical scenario is to process an <code>include</code> directive in the source input that should include the source of another file before continuing with the current input.</p>
<p>For example, the following lex specification processes <code>#include</code> directives by switching matchers and using the stack of matchers to permit nested <code>#include</code> directives up to a depth of 99 files:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%top{</div>

<p>To read from the input without pattern matching, use <code>matcher().input()</code> to read one character at a time (8-bit, ASCII or UTF-8). This function returns EOF if the end of the input was reached. But be careful, the Flex <code>yyinput()</code> and <code>input()</code> functions return 0 instead of an <code>EOF</code> (-1)!</p>

Start condition states                                         </h2>
<p>Start conditions are used to group rules and selectively activate rules when the start condition state becomes active.</p>
<p>A rule with a pattern that is prefixed with one ore more start conditions will only be active when the scanner is in one of these start condition states.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">&lt;A,B&gt;pattern1    action1</div>
<div class="line">&lt;A&gt;pattern2      action2</div>
<div class="line">&lt;B&gt;pattern3      action3</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>When the scanner is in state <code>A</code> rules 1 and 2 are active. When the scanner is in state <code>B</code> rules 1 and 3 are active.</p>
<p>Start conditions are declared in the definitions section (the first section) of the lex specification using <code>%state</code> or <code>%xstate</code> (or <code>%s</code> and <code>%x</code> for short) followed by a list of names called <em>start symbols</em>. Start conditions declared with <code>%s</code> are <em>inclusive start conditions</em>. Start conditions declared with <code>%x</code> are <em>exclusive start conditions</em>.</p>
<p>If a start condition is inclusive, then all rules without a start condition and rules with the corresponding start condition will be active.</p>
<p>If a start condition is exclusive, only the rules with the corresponding start condition will be active.</p>
<p>When declaring start symbol names it is recommended to use all upper case to avoid name clashes with other Lexer class members. For example, we cannot use <code>text</code> as a start symbol name because <code>text()</code> is a Lexer method. When option <code>−−flex</code> is used, start symbol names are simple macros for compatibility.</p>
<p>The scanner is initially in the <code>INITIAL</code> start condition state. The <code>INITIAL</code> start condtion is inclusive: all rules without a start condition and those prefixed with the <code>INITIAL</code> start condition are active when the scanner is in the <code>INITIAL</code> start condition state.</p>
<p>The special start condition prefix <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> matches every start condition. The prefix <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> is not needed for <code>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> rules, because unprefixed <code>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> rules are always active, as a special case (<code>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> and this special exception were introduced by Flex).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%s A</div>
<div class="line">%x B</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">&lt;A,B&gt;pattern1    action1    <span class="comment">// rule for states A and B</span></div>
<div class="line">&lt;A&gt;pattern2      action2    <span class="comment">// rule for state A</span></div>
<div class="line">&lt;B&gt;pattern3      action3    <span class="comment">// rule for state B</span></div>
<div class="line">&lt;*&gt;pattern4      action4    <span class="comment">// rule for states INITIAL, A and B</span></div>
<div class="line">pattern5         action5    <span class="comment">// rule for states INITIAL and A</span></div>
<div class="line">&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;          action6    <span class="comment">// rule for states INITIAL, A and B</span></div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>When the scanner is in state <code>INITIAL</code> rules 4, 5, and 6 are active. When the scanner is in state <code>A</code> rules 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are active. When the scanner is in state <code>B</code> rules 1, 3, 4, and 6 are active. Note that <code>A</code> is inclusive whereas <code>B</code> is exclusive.</p>
<p>To switch to a start condition state, use <code>start(START)</code> (or <code>BEGIN START</code> when option <code>−−flex</code> is used). To get the current state use <code>start()</code> (or <code>YY_START</code> when option <code>−−flex</code> is used). Switching start condition states in your scanner allows you to create "mini-scanners" to scan portions of the input that are syntactically different from the rest of the input, such as comments:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%x COMMENT</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">&quot;/*&quot;</span>    start(COMMENT);    <span class="comment">// with −−flex use: BEGIN COMMENT;</span></div>
<div class="line">.|\n    echo();            <span class="comment">// with −−flex use: ECHO;</span></div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">&lt;COMMENT&gt;[^*]*         <span class="comment">// eat anything that is not a &#39;*&#39;</span></div>
<div class="line">&lt;COMMENT&gt;<span class="stringliteral">&quot;*&quot;</span>+[^*/]*    <span class="comment">// eat &#39;*&#39;s not followed by a &#39;/&#39;</span></div>

<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>Start symbols are actually integer values, where <code>INITIAL</code> is 0. This means that you can store a start symbol value in a variable. You can also push the current start condition on a stack and transition to start condition <code>START</code> with <code>push_state(START)</code>. To transition to a start condition that is on the top of the stack and pop it use <code>pop_state()</code>. The <code>top_state()</code> returns the start condition that is on the top of the stack:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%x COMMENT</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
<div class="line"></div>

<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>When many rules are prefixed by the same start conditions, you can simplify the rules by placing them in a <em>start condition scope</em>:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">&lt;COMMENT&gt;{</div>
<div class="line">[^*]*         <span class="comment">// eat anything that is not a &#39;*&#39;</span></div>

Interfacing with Bison and Yacc                                 </h2>
<p>The <a href="dinosaur.compilertools.net/#bison">Bison</a> tools generate parsers that invoke the global C function <code>yylex()</code> to get the next token. Tokens are integer values returned by <code>yylex()</code>.</p>
<p>To support Bison parsers use <b>reflex</b> option <code>−−bison</code>. This option generates a scanner with a global lexer object <code>YY_SCANNER</code> and a global <code>YY_EXTERN_C int yylex()</code> function. When the Bison parser is compiled in C and the scanner is compiled in C++, you must set <code>YY_EXTERN_C</code> in the lex specification to <code>extern "C"</code> to enable C linkage rules:</p>
<div class="alt"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">%top{</div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">  #include &quot;y.tab.h&quot;</span>               <span class="comment">/* include y.tab.h generated by bison */</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">  #define YY_EXTERN_C extern &quot;C&quot;   </span><span class="comment">/* yylex() must use C linkage rules */</span><span class="preprocessor"></span></div>

<div class="line"><span class="stringliteral">%%</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>This example sets the global <code>yylval.num</code> to the integer scanned or <code>yylval.str</code> to the string scanned. It assumes that the yacc grammar specification defines the tokens <code>CONST_NUMBER</code> and <code>CONST_STRING</code> and the type <code>YYSTYPE</code> of <code>yylval</code>, which is a union. For example:</p>

<p>There are two approaches for a Bison parser to work with a scanner. Either the yacc grammar specification for Bison should include the externs we need to import from the scanner:</p>

<div class="line">%%</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> </div><p>The second option requires the generated parser to be compiled in C++, because <code>lex.yy.h</code> contains C++ declarations.</p>
<p>The ugly Flex macro <code>YY_DECL</code> is not supported by RE/flex. This macro is needed with Flex to redeclare the <code>yyflex()</code> function signature, for example to take an additional <code>yylval</code> parameter that must be passed through from <code>yyparse()</code> to <code>yylex()</code>.</p>

<p>The RE/flex regex library is a class hierarchy that has at the root an abstract class <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_abstract_matcher.html">reflex::AbstractMatcher</a></code>. Pattern types may differ between for matchers so the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern_matcher.html" title="< ">reflex::PatternMatcher</a></code> template class takes a pattern type and creates a class that is complete except for the implementation of the <code>reflex::match()</code> virtual method that requires a regex engine, such as Boost.Regex or the RE/flex engine.</p>
<p>The <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher.html">reflex::BoostMatcher</a></code> inherits <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern_matcher.html" title="< ">reflex::PatternMatcher</a>&lt;boost::regex&gt;</code>, and in turn the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_perl_matcher.html">reflex::BoostPerlMatcher</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_posix_matcher.html">reflex::BoostPosixMatcher</a></code> are both derived from <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher.html">reflex::BoostMatcher</a></code>:</p>

These flags are the only difference with the plain <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher.html">reflex::BoostMatcher</a></code>.</p>
<p>An instance of <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_posix_matcher.html">reflex::BoostPosixMatcher</a></code> creates a POSIX matcher. This means that lazy quantifiers are not supported and the "leftmost-longest rule" applies to pattern matching. This instance is initialized with the flags <code>match_posix</code> and <code>match_not_dot_newline</code>.</p>
<p>Boost.Regex is a powerful library. The RE/flex regex API enhances this library with operations to match, search, scan, and split data from a given input. The input can be a file, a string, or a stream. Files that are UTF-8/16/32-encoded are automatically decoded. Further, streams can be of unlimited length because internal buffering is used by the RE/flex regex API enhancements to efficiently apply Boost.Regex pattern matching to streaming data. This enhancement permits pattern matching of interactive input from the console, such that searching and scanning interactive input for matches will return these matches immediately.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_boost_matcher.html">reflex::BoostMatcher</a></code> extends the capabilities of Boost.Regex, which does not natively support streaming input:</dd>
<dd>
The Boost.Regex library requires the target text to be loaded into memory for pattern matching. It is possible to match a target text incrementally with the <code>match_partial</code> flag and <code>boost::regex_iterator</code>. Incremental matching can be used to support matching on (possibly infinite) streams. To use this method correctly, a buffer should be created that is large enough to hold the text for each match. The buffer must adjust with a growing size of the matched text, to ensure that long matches that do not fit the buffer are not discared.</dd>
<dd>
Boost.Regex <code>Boost.IOStreams</code> with <code>regex_filter</code> loads the entire stream into memory which does not permit pattern matching of streaming and interactive input data.</dd>
<dd>
The C++11 regex library does not support <code>match_partial</code> that is required to implement pattern matching on buffered input streams (when the buffer should be allowed to grow to hold longer matches as the RE/flex regex API requires).</dd></dl>

<p>where the RE/flex <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern.html">reflex::Pattern</a></code> class represents a regex pattern. Patterns as regex texts are internally compiled into deterministic finite state machines by the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern.html">reflex::Pattern</a></code> class. The machines are used by the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a></code> for fast matching of regex patterns on some given input. The <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a></code> can be much faster than the Boost.Regex matchers.</p>
<p>A <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a></code> engine is constructed from a <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern.html">reflex::Pattern</a></code> object, or a string regex, and some given input:</p>

Pattern matching methods                                       </h2>
<p>The RE/flex abstract matcher offers four operations for matching with the regex engines that are derived from this base abstract class:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Method </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>matches()</code> </td><td>true if the input from begin to end matches the regex pattern </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>find()</code> </td><td>search input and return true if a match was found </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>scan()</code> </td><td>scan input and return true if input at current position matches </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>split()</code> </td><td>split input at the next match </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The <code>find</code>, <code>scan</code>, and <code>split</code> methods are also implemented as input iterators that apply filtering tokenization, and splitting:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Iterator range </th><th>Acts as a </th><th>Iterates over  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>find.begin()</code>...<code>find.end()</code> </td><td>filter </td><td>all matches </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>scan.begin()</code>...<code>scan.end()</code> </td><td>tokenizer </td><td>continuous matches </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>split.begin()</code>...<code>split.end()</code> </td><td>splitter </td><td>text between matches </td></tr>
</table>
<p>To obtain details of a match use the following methods:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Method </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>accept()</code> </td><td>returns group capture or zero if not captured/matched </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>text()</code> </td><td>returns <code>\0</code>-terminated <code>const char*</code> string match </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pair()</code> </td><td>returns <code>std::pair&lt;size_t,const char*&gt;(accept(), text())</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>size()</code> </td><td>returns the length of the text match in bytes </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rest()</code> </td><td>returns <code>\0</code>-terminated <code>const char*</code> of the rest of the input </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>more()</code> </td><td>tells the matcher to append the next match (adjacent matches) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>less(n)</code> </td><td>cuts <code>text()</code> to <code>n</code> bytes and repositions the matcher </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>lineno()</code> </td><td>returns line number of the match, starting with line 1 </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>columno()</code> </td><td>returns column number of the match, starting with 0 </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>first()</code> </td><td>returns position of the first character of the match </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>last()</code> </td><td>returns position of the last + 1 character of the match </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>at_bol()</code> </td><td>true if matcher reached the begin of a new line <code>\n</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>at_bob()</code> </td><td>true if matcher is at the start of input, no matches consumed </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>at_end()</code> </td><td>true if matcher is at the end of input </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Two special methods can be used to manipulate the input stream directly:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Method </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>input()</code> </td><td>returns the next character from the input, matcher then skips it </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>unput(c)</code> </td><td>put character <code>c</code> back unto the stream, matcher then takes it </td></tr>
</table>
<p>These methods operate on the <code>in</code> public instance variable of a matcher:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Variable </th><th>Usage  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>in</code> </td><td>the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a></code> object used by the matcher </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>find</code> </td><td>the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_abstract_matcher_1_1_operation.html" title="AbstractMatcher::Operation functor to match input to a pattern, also provides a (const) AbstractMatch...">reflex::AbstractMatcher::Operation</a></code> functor for searching </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>scan</code> </td><td>the <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_abstract_matcher_1_1_operation.html" title="AbstractMatcher::Operation functor to match input to a pattern, also provides a (const) AbstractMatch...">reflex::AbstractMatcher::Operation</a></code> functor for scanning </td></tr>
<tr>

</table>
<p>To initialize a matcher for interactive use, to assign a new input source or to change its pattern, you can use the following methods:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Method </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>input(i)</code> </td><td>set input to <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a> i</code> (string, stream, or <code>FILE*</code>) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pattern(p)</code> </td><td>set pattern to <code>p</code> (string regex or <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_pattern.html">reflex::Pattern</a></code>) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>buffer(n)</code> </td><td>set internal buffer size to <code>n</code> bytes to buffer the input </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>buffer()</code> </td><td>buffer all input at once, returns true if successful </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>interactive()</code> </td><td>sets buffer size to 1 for console-based (TTY) input </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>flush()</code> </td><td>flush the remaining input from the internal buffer </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>reset()</code> </td><td>resets the matcher, restarting it from the remaining input </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>reset(o)</code> </td><td>resets the matcher with new options string <code>o</code> ("A?N?T?") </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The first two methods return a reference to the matcher, so multiple method invocations can be chained together.</p>

The Input class                                                  </h2>
<p>A matcher may accept several types of input, but can only read from one input source at a time. Input to a matcher is represented by a single <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a></code> class instance that the matcher uses internally.</p>
<p>An input object can be assigned <code>std::string</code> and <code>char*</code> strings, wide strings <code>std::wstring</code> and <code>wchar_t*</code>, a <code>FILE*</code>, or a <code>std::istream</code>.</p>
<p>Wide strings are internally converted to UTF-8 for matching, which effectively normalizes the content. A <code>FILE*</code> with content in UTF-16 or UTF-32 is converted internally (i.e. streaming) for matching to UTF-8.</p>
<p>Conversion from wide string to UTF-8 is shown in the example below. The copyright symbol <code>©</code> with Unicode U+00A9 is matched against its UTF-8 sequence <code>C2 A9</code>:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">if</span> (<a class="code" href="classreflex_1_1_matcher.html">reflex::Matcher</a>(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;\xc2\xa9&quot;</span>, L<span class="stringliteral">&quot;©&quot;</span>).matches())</div>
<div class="line">  std::cout &lt;&lt; <span class="stringliteral">&quot;copyright symbol matches\n&quot;</span>;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>To obtain the properties of an input object use the following methods:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Method </th><th>Result  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>size()</code> </td><td>size of the input in (UTF-encoded) bytes, or zero when unknown </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>good()</code> </td><td>input is available to read (no error and not EOF) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>eof()</code> </td><td>end of input (but use only <code>at_end()</code> with matchers!) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>cstring()</code> </td><td>the current <code>const char*</code> (of a <code>std::string</code>) or NULL </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>wstring()</code> </td><td>the current <code>const wchar_t*</code> (of a <code>std::wstring</code>) or NULL </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>file()</code> </td><td>the current <code>FILE*</code> file descriptor or NULL </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>istream()</code> </td><td>a <code>std::istream*</code> pointer to the current stream object or NULL </td></tr>
</table>
<p>File content specified with a <code>FILE*</code> file descriptor can be encoded in ASCII, binary, or UTF-8/16/32 formats. UTF-16/32 file content is converted internally to UTF-8 (i.e. streaming) to normalize the input for matching.</p>
<p>A <a href="www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html">UTF byte order mark (BOM)</a> is detected in the content of a file by the matcher, which enables UTF-8 normalization of the input automatically.</p>
<p>The file encoding is obtained with the <code>file_encoding()</code> method of a <code><a class="el" href="classreflex_1_1_input.html">reflex::Input</a></code> object and it returns one of:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Encoding constant </th><th>Effect when set  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Input::Const::plain</code> </td><td>plain octets with ASCII, binary, or UTF-8 </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Input::Const::utf16be</code> </td><td>UCS-2/UTF-16 big endian </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Input::Const::utf16le</code> </td><td>UCS-2/UTF-16 little endian </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Input::Const::utf32be</code> </td><td>UCS-4/UTF-32 big endian </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Input::Const::utf32le</code> </td><td>UCS-4/UTF-32 little endian </td></tr>
